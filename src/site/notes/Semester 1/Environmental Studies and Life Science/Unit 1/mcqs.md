*   A) Charles Darwin
*   B) Ernst Haeckel
*   C) Arthur Tansley
*   D) E.P. Odum

<details>
<summary><strong>Check Answer</strong></summary>

> **Correct Answer: B) Ernst Haeckel**

</details>

### Question 2
In an ecological pyramid, approximately what percentage of **energy** is transferred from one trophic level to the next?
*   A) 100%
*   B) 50%
*   C) 10%
*   D) 1%

<details>
<summary><strong>Check Answer</strong></summary>

> **Correct Answer: C) 10%**

*   C) Nitrate ($NO_3^-$)
*   D) Nitrogen gas ($N_2$)

<details>
<summary><strong>Check Answer</strong></summary>

> **Correct Answer: B) Ammonia ($NH_3$)**
> Bacteria convert inert nitrogen gas into ammonia, a usable form for plants.
</details>

### Question 5
Which "Clean Energy" source uses the **Photovoltaic Effect** (PV)?
*   A) Wind Energy

## Pollution & Disaster Management

### Question 6
Which of the following describes **BSL-4** (Biosafety Level 4)?
*   A) Microbes not known to cause disease (e.g., E. coli).
*   B) Moderate hazards requiring autoclaves (e.g., HIV).
*   C) Severe disease but treatable (e.g., Anthrax).
*   D) Fatal viruses requiring positive pressure suits (e.g., Ebola).

<details>
<summary><strong>Check Answer</strong></summary>

> **Correct Answer: D) Fatal viruses requiring positive pressure suits (e.g., Ebola).**
> BSL-4 involves the highest level of containment for life-threatening agents with no vaccine/cure.
</details>

### Question 7
In the Waste Management Hierarchy, which is the **most preferable** option?
*   A) Recycling
*   B) Treatment
*   C) Pollution Prevention (Source Reduction)
*   D) Disposal (Landfill)

<details>
<summary><strong>Check Answer</strong></summary>

> **Correct Answer: C) Pollution Prevention (Source Reduction)**
> Avoiding the creation of waste is always prioritized over treating or recycling it.
</details>

### Question 8
**Eutrophication** (and subsequent algal blooms) in water bodies is primarily caused by runoff containing:
*   A) Heavy metals
*   B) Fertilizers (Nitrates/Phosphates)
*   C) Radioactive waste
*   D) Oil spills

<details>
<summary><strong>Check Answer</strong></summary>

> **Correct Answer: B) Fertilizers (Nitrates/Phosphates)**
> Nutrient enrichment leads to excessive algae growth, depleting oxygen.
</details>

### Question 9
In Disaster Management, **Mitigation** refers to:
*   A) Search and rescue operations immediately after a disaster.
*   B) Rebuilding infrastructure after the event.
*   C) Activities to prevent or lessen adverse effects (Long-term prevention).
*   D) Providing food and shelter to victims.

<details>
<summary><strong>Check Answer</strong></summary>

> **Correct Answer: C) Activities to prevent or lessen adverse effects (Long-term prevention).**
> Mitigation happens before a disaster to reduce its potential impact.
</details>

### Question 10
Which gas is primarily responsible for **Global Warming** due to the greenhouse effect?
*   A) Sulfur Dioxide ($SO_2$)
*   B) Carbon Dioxide ($CO_2$)
*   C) Carbon Monoxide ($CO$)
*   D) Nitrogen Dioxide ($NO_2$)

<details>
<summary><strong>Check Answer</strong></summary>

> **Correct Answer: B) Carbon Dioxide ($CO_2$)**
> CO2 traps heat in the atmosphere, driving climate change.
</details>
