# Unit 1: Q&A

### 1. What is the difference between an ecosystem and a biome?
#### Answer
An **ecosystem** is a specific geographic area where living (biotic) and non-living (abiotic) components interact (e.g., a single tide pool, an oasis). A **biome** is a much larger region of land, sea, or atmosphere characterized by its general climate and the types of plants and animals that live there (e.g., the entire Sahara Desert, a tropical rainforest). A biome can contain many different ecosystems.

### 2. What are the three trophic levels in a food chain?
#### Answer
1.  **Producers:** Organisms that create their own food, usually via photosynthesis (e.g., plants, algae).
2.  **Consumers:** Organisms that eat other organisms (e.g., primary, secondary, and tertiary consumers).
3.  **Decomposers:** Organisms that break down dead organic matter, recycling nutrients back into the ecosystem (e.g., fungi, bacteria).

### 3. How does energy flow differ from matter cycling in an ecosystem?
#### Answer
* **Energy Flow:** Energy flows **one way** through an ecosystem. It typically enters as sunlight, is transferred up the trophic levels (with ~90% loss at each step), and ultimately exits the ecosystem as heat.
* **Matter Cycling:** Matter (atoms and nutrients) is **recycled** within an ecosystem. Decomposers break down dead organisms, returning essential elements to the soil and water to be used again by producers.

### 4. What is a "keystone species"?
#### Answer
A keystone species is a species that has an exceptionally large impact on its ecosystem relative to its abundance. If a keystone species is removed, the entire ecosystem can change drastically, as it fills a critical role that no other species can. A classic example is the starfish, which controls mussel populations, allowing other species to thrive.

### 5. What is the difference between renewable and non-renewable energy?
#### Answer
* **Non-renewable energy** comes from sources that can be depleted and cannot be replaced on a human timescale (e.g., fossil fuels like coal and oil, and nuclear materials like uranium).
* **Renewable energy** comes from sources that will not run out, are self-replenishing, and are usually low-carbon (e.g., solar, wind, and hydroelectric power).

### 6. What are the four main types of coal, from lowest to highest carbon content?
#### Answer
1.  **Peat** (~50% carbon)
2.  **Lignite** (~70% carbon)
3.  **Bituminous** (~85% carbon)
4.  **Anthracite** (>90% carbon)

### 7. What is the difference between nuclear fission and fusion?
#### Answer
* **Fission** is the process of **splitting** the nucleus of a large atom (like Uranium-235) into smaller parts, releasing energy. This is what nuclear power plants use.
* **Fusion** is the process of **joining** (fusing) the nuclei of small atoms to form a larger one, releasing energy.

### 8. What is the difference between a point source and a non-point source of water pollution?
#### Answer
* A **point source** is a single, identifiable source of pollution, like a discharge pipe from a factory or a city sewer system.
* A **non-point (or dispersed) source** is a broad, unconfined area from which pollutants enter the water, such as agricultural runoff containing fertilizers or urban stormwater.

### 9. What are Biosafety Levels (BSL)?
#### Answer
Biosafety Levels are a set of four classifications (BSL-1 to BSL-4) that describe the safety precautions required to handle biological agents.
* **BSL-1** is for low-risk microbes (e.g., non-pathogenic *E. coli*).
* **BSL-2** is for moderate-risk agents (e.g., HIV, Hepatitis).
* **BSL-3** is for agents that can cause serious or fatal disease via inhalation (e.g., anthrax).
* **BSL-4** is for high-risk, fatal, and often untreatable agents (e.g., Ebola).

### 10. What is the difference between Heat Exhaustion and Heat Stroke?
#### Answer
* **Heat Exhaustion:** The body's response to an excessive loss of water and salt, usually through **excessive sweating**. Symptoms include cool/pale/clammy skin and a **rapid, weak pulse**.
* **Heat Stroke:** A more severe, life-threatening condition where the body's temperature control system fails. The body **stops sweating** and cannot cool down. Symptoms include red/hot/dry skin, a body temperature above 103°F, and a **rapid, strong pulse**.

### 11. What were the key differences between the Chernobyl and Bhopal disasters?
#### Answer
* The **Chernobyl disaster (1986)** was a **nuclear disaster** involving a flawed reactor design and human error, resulting in a steam explosion and fire that released a massive amount of radioactive material.
* The **Bhopal Gas Tragedy (1984)** was a **chemical disaster** caused by substandard safety procedures, leading to the accidental release of highly toxic Methyl Isocyanate (MIC) gas from a pesticide factory.

### 12. What is the Waste Management Hierarchy?
#### Answer
It is a framework that prioritizes waste management strategies from most to least preferable:
1.  **Pollution Prevention (Source Reduction)**
2.  **Re-Use**
3.  **Recycling**
4.  **Treatment**
5.  **Disposal/Release**

### 13. What is the goal of radioactive waste management?
#### Answer
The goal is to isolate or dilute radioactive waste to ensure that the rate or concentration of any radionuclides returned to the biosphere is harmless. This is achieved by containing and managing all waste, with some requiring deep and permanent burial.
