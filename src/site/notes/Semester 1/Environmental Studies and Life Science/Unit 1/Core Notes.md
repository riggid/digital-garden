# Unit 1: Environmental Studies & Life Sciences

## Basic Concepts of Ecosystem

**Ecology:** The term, derived from the Greek words **OIKOS** (house) and **LOGUS** (study of), was coined by Ernst Haeckel in 1869. It denotes the relationship between organisms and their environment.

**Ecosystem:** A geographic area where plants, animals, and other organisms, as well as weather and landscape, work together. It consists of the living community (biotic) and the non-living components (abiotic).

### Ecosystem Components
* **Biotic Factors:** Living parts, including plants, animals, and other organisms.
* **Abiotic Factors:** Nonliving parts, such as rocks, temperature, humidity, soil, air, and water.
* **Interdependence:** Every factor in an ecosystem depends on every other factor. A change in an abiotic factor (like temperature) will affect the plants, which in turn affects the animals that depend on them.

### Biomes and Classification
* **Biome:** A large section of land, sea, or atmosphere characterized by its plants and animals (e.g., forests, ponds, reefs, tundra). A biome can contain many different ecosystems.
* **Ecosystem Classification:**
    * **Natural:** Classified into Terrestrial (land) and Aquatic (water) ecosystems.
        * **Terrestrial:** Forest, Grassland, Desert.
        * **Aquatic:**
            * **Marine:** Coastal Areas (estuaries, coral reefs), Upwelling Regions, Open Oceans.
            * **Fresh Water:**
                * **Lotic:** Moving water (e.g., rivers, streams).
                * **Lentic:** Still water (e.g., ponds, lakes).
                * **Wetlands:** (e.g., marshes, swamps).
    * **Artificial:** Natural regions affected by human interference (e.g., artificial lakes, cities, townships).
* **Study Area Classification:**
    * **Autecology (Species Ecology):** Study of an individual species and its population.
    * **Synecology:** Study of communities, their composition, and their relation to the environment.

### Ecosystem Dynamics
* **Food Chain:** Describes who eats whom. Organisms are grouped into **trophic levels**:
    1.  **Producers (First Level):** Create their own food (e.g., plants).
    2.  **Consumers (Second, Third, Fourth Levels):**
        * **Primary Consumer:** Eats producers (e.g., grasshopper).
        * **Secondary Consumer:** Eats primary consumers (e.g., bird).
        * **Tertiary Consumer:** Eats secondary consumers (e.g., snake).
        * **Apex Predator:** At the top of the food chain (e.g., owl).
    3.  **Decomposers:** Break down dead organisms (e.g., mushroom).
* **Food Web:** A collection of all interconnected food chains in an ecosystem.
* **Ecological Pyramid:** A model showing the relative amount of energy or biomass at each trophic level. Energy transfer between levels is typically inefficient (around 10%).
* **Energy Flow:** Energy flows **one way** through an ecosystem (e.g., as sunlight) and eventually exits as heat.
* **Matter Cycling:** Matter (atoms) is continuously **recycled** within an ecosystem.
    * **Biogeochemical Cycles:** The movement of nutrients and elements between biotic and abiotic factors.
    * **Carbon Cycle:** The recycling of carbon through the atmosphere, organisms (photosynthesis, respiration), and Earth's crust (rocks, fossil fuels).
    * **Nitrogen Cycle:** The process of converting inert nitrogen gas ($N_2$) into usable forms like ammonia ($NH_3$) via **nitrogen fixation** by bacteria.
    * **Oxygen Cycle:** The movement of oxygen through the atmosphere, lithosphere (Earth's crust), and biosphere. It is interconnected with the carbon cycle.

### Ecosystem Degradation
* **Threats:** Human population growth has led to the overtaking of ecosystems, such as converting prairies to farmland or clearing rainforests.
* **Ecocide:** The destruction of entire ecosystems by human beings.
* **Examples:**
    * **Coral Bleaching:** Rising ocean temperatures and decreased salinity cause corals to lose their color and die, leading to ecosystem collapse.
    * **Great Barrier Reef:** Health has declined due to coastal development, pollution, and mass bleaching events from global warming.
* **Keystone Species:** A species that, if eliminated, would cause the entire ecosystem to change drastically. They fill a critical role no other species can.
* **Biodiversity:** The variety of all different kinds of life in one area (animals, plants, fungi, microorganisms). Ecosystems with high biodiversity are more resilient and can recover from pressure.

## Energy Resources

**Energy Resource:** Something that can produce heat, power life, move objects, or produce electricity.

### Classification of Energy
* **Non-Renewable Energy:** Resources that cannot be replaced on a human timescale (e.g., fossil fuels, nuclear material).
* **Renewable Energy:** Energy from a source that won't run out (e.g., solar, wind, hydro).

### Non-Renewable Resources
* **Fossil Fuels:** Hydrocarbon fuels (coal, oil, natural gas) formed from prehistoric organisms.
    * **Formation:**
        * **Coal:** Formed from giant plants in swamps buried under water and dirt for millions of years.
        * **Oil & Gas:** Formed from tiny sea plants and animals buried under silt and sand, with heat and pressure turning them into oil and gas.
    * **Types of Coal (by carbon content):**
        1.  **Peat:** ~50% carbon.
        2.  **Lignite (Brown Coal):** ~70% carbon.
        3.  **Bituminous (Soft Coal):** ~85% carbon.
        4.  **Anthracite (Hard Coal):** >90% carbon (cleanest burning).
    * **Crude Oil (Petroleum):** Refined through a **fractionating column** to separate products like gasoline, diesel, kerosene, and jet fuel.
    * **Advantages:** Widely used (~80% of consumption), easier to store and transport, reliable, can generate large amounts of electricity.
    * **Disadvantages:** Emits $\text{CO}_2$ (global warming), non-renewable, causes acid rain, environmental damage from extraction (strip mining, oil spills), and health effects (e.g., Black Lung Disease).
* **Nuclear Energy:** Energy released from the nucleus of atoms.
    * **Fission:** Splitting nuclei of atoms (like Uranium-235) into smaller parts. This is used in nuclear power plants.
    * **Fusion:** Joining nuclei of small atoms to form larger ones.
    * **Status:** Considered non-renewable because the material (like uranium) is finite.
    * **Process:** Nuclear reactors use fission to create heat, which makes steam, which turns a turbine to generate electricity.
    * **Waste:** Produces dangerous, radioactive wastes that must be carefully managed.

### Renewable Resources
* **Wind:** Uses turbines to convert the kinetic energy of wind into electricity.
* **Solar:** Captures sunlight on solar panels using the **photovoltaic effect (PV)**. Also includes solar collectors (for heat) and solar mirrors (large-scale).
* **Hydroelectric:** Uses the movement of flowing or falling water (dams) or ocean forces (wave and tidal power) to turn turbines.
* **Bioenergy (Biomass):** Burning organic matter (plants, timber, food waste) as fuel. Includes **Gasohol** (alcohol from plants mixed with gasoline).
* **Geothermal:** Harnesses heat from the Earth. Steam from **geysers** (natural vents) can be used to generate electricity.
* **Disadvantages:** Can be expensive (solar), location-dependent (wind, geo, hydro), or disrupt ecosystems (hydro dams). Biomass requires large land areas and produces smoke.

**Clean vs. Green vs. Renewable:**
* **Renewable:** Source won't run out.
* **Clean:** Produces electricity without emissions (but manufacturing might have a carbon cost, e.g., building a hydro dam).
* **Green:** Comes from totally natural sources with low/no environmental impact in creation or use.
* *Note:* Most green energy is renewable, but not all renewable energy is green (e.g., a large dam).

## Environmental Pollution

**Pollution:** The introduction of harmful materials (pollutants) into the environment.
* **Pollutants:** Can be natural (e.g., volcanic ash) or created by human activity (e.g., trash, factory runoff).
* **Causes:** Key drivers include industrialization, urbanization/population growth, and globalization.

### Types of Pollution

    * **Effects:** **Noise Induced Hearing Loss (NIHL)**, high blood pressure, heart disease, sleep disturbances, and stress.
    * **Guideline:** Sound levels less than **70 dB** are generally not damaging.

5.  **Thermal Pollution:** Rapid change in temperature in a natural body of water.
    * **Causes:** Heated discharge from industrial facilities (e.g., power plants, desalination plants) that use water for cooling.
    * **Effects:** Decreases the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water, which can stress, sicken, or kill aquatic organisms.

6.  **Radioactive Pollution:** Deposition or introduction of radioactive substances into the environment.
    * **Sources:** Nuclear explosions, testing of nuclear weapons, mining of radioactive ores, accidents at nuclear facilities.
    * **Effects:** Acute effects (skin burns, **acute radiation syndrome**), and long-term effects (cancer, cardiovascular disease, lung disease).

### Waste Management Hierarchy
A framework prioritizing waste management strategies from most to least preferable:
1.  **Pollution Prevention (Source Reduction):** Avoid creating waste.
2.  **Re-Use:** Use materials again for the same purpose.
3.  **Recycling:** Reclaiming/recovering materials or energy.
4.  **Treatment:** Processing waste to reduce its impact.
5.  **Disposal/Release:** (e.g., landfill) The last resort.

### Air Pollution Management

* **Recycling:** Treated industrial water can be recycled for domestic use or industrial heating.

### Radioactive Waste Management
* **Goal:** To isolate or dilute waste so that any radionuclides returned to the biosphere are harmless.
* **Method:** All waste is regulated and contained. Some requires deep and permanent burial.
* **Prevention:**
    * Minimize volume and toxicity of waste.
    * Avoid ordering excess radioactive materials.
    * **Never mix non-radioactive waste with radioactive waste.**
    * Substitute with short-lived radionuclides or non-radioactive methods where possible.
    * Limit the number of users and areas where radioactive materials are used.
