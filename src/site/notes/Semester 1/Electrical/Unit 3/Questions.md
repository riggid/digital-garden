# Unit 3 Q&A: Three Phase Systems & Installations

## 1. Three Phase Balanced Systems

*   **1. Define "Phase Sequence" with respect to a three-phase system.**
    *   **Answer**: Phase Sequence is the order in which the three-phase voltages attain their peak positive values. The standard sequence is R-Y-B. See [[Semester 1/Electrical/Unit 3/Core Notes#11-generation-of-balanced-three-phase-emfs\|Core Notes]].

*   **2. Define a "Balanced Three Phase System" of voltages.**
    *   **Answer**: A system where the three phase voltages are equal in magnitude and displaced from each other by 120 electrical degrees. See [[Semester 1/Electrical/Unit 3/Core Notes#11-generation-of-balanced-three-phase-emfs\|Core Notes]].

*   **3. What is the relation between Line and Phase voltages in a Star Connected system?**
    *   **Answer**: Line voltage is $\sqrt{3}$ times the Phase voltage and leads it by 30°. ($V_L = \sqrt{3}V_{ph}$). See [[Semester 1/Electrical/Unit 3/Core Notes#122-relationships-in-star-connection\|Core Notes]].

*   **4. What is the relation between Line and Phase currents in a Delta Connected system?**
    *   **Answer**: Line current is $\sqrt{3}$ times the Phase current and lags it by 30°. ($I_L = \sqrt{3}I_{ph}$). See [[Semester 1/Electrical/Unit 3/Core Notes#131-relationships-in-delta-connection\|Core Notes]].

*   **5. How many coils are present in a wattmeter and what are they called?**
    *   **Answer**: Two coils: The **Current Coil (CC)** (connected in series with the load) and the **Pressure/Voltage Coil (PC)** (connected across the supply). See [[Semester 1/Electrical/Unit 3/Core Notes#15-measurement-of-power-two-wattmeter-method\|Core Notes]].

*   **6. In the Two Wattmeter method, what does it indicate if one wattmeter reads zero?**
    *   **Answer**: It indicates that the power factor of the load is exactly **0.5 (Lagging)**, meaning the phase angle is 60°. See [[Semester 1/Electrical/Unit 3/Core Notes#151-variation-of-wattmeter-readings-with-power-factor\|Core Notes]].

*   **7. In the Two Wattmeter method, what does it indicate if one wattmeter gives a negative reading?**
    *   **Answer**: It indicates that the power factor is **less than 0.5** (phase angle > 60°). The connections of the pressure coil must be reversed to take the reading, which is then subtracted. See [[Semester 1/Electrical/Unit 3/Core Notes#151-variation-of-wattmeter-readings-with-power-factor\|Core Notes]].

## 2. Electrical Installations

*   **8. Write a short note on the necessity of earthing.**
    *   **Answer**: Earthing protects human life from electric shock, protects equipment from overvoltage/lightning, and provides a safe path for fault currents to blow the fuse/trip the breaker. See [[Semester 1/Electrical/Unit 3/Core Notes#25-earthing-grounding\|Core Notes]].

*   **9. Discuss the working of an MCB.**
    *   **Answer**: proper MCB uses a bimetallic strip for thermal overload protection (slow, small overcurrents) and a magnetic trip coil for short circuit protection (fast, large currents). See [[Semester 1/Electrical/Unit 3/Core Notes#22-miniature-circuit-breaker-mcb\|Core Notes]].

*   **10. Discuss the working of an RCCB.**
    *   **Answer**: An RCCB operates on the principle of Kirchhoff's Current Law, monitoring the vector sum of line and neutral currents. If the sum is not zero (indicating leakage to earth), it trips the circuit. See [[Semester 1/Electrical/Unit 3/Core Notes#23-earth-leakage-circuit-breaker-elcb-rccb\|Core Notes]].

*   **11. Differentiate between a Wire and a Cable.**
    *   **Answer**: A wire is a single electrical conductor (solid or stranded), while a cable consists of one or more insulated conductors grouped together in a sheath. See [[Semester 1/Electrical/Unit 3/Core Notes#26-wires-and-cables\|Core Notes]].

*   **12. List the components of a typical earthing system.**
    *   **Answer**: Earth Electrode (Plate/Pipe), Earthing Lead, and Earth Continuity Conductor. See [[Semester 1/Electrical/Unit 3/Core Notes#25-earthing-grounding\|Core Notes]].

> See also: [[Semester 1/Electrical/Unit 3/Core Notes#1-three-phase-balanced-systems\|Core Notes]]

## 1. Balanced Star Connected Systems

### Example 1: Active and Reactive Power Calculation
**Problem:**
A balanced 3-phase load consists of three coils, each of $4\Omega$ resistance and $0.02H$ inductance. Determine the total active and reactive power when the coils are connected in star, if the supply voltage is $400V, 50 Hz$.

**Solution:**

**1. Identify Given Data:**
*   Supply Line Voltage ($V_L$) = $400V$
*   Frequency ($f$) = $50Hz$
*   Resistance per phase ($R$) = $4\Omega$
*   Inductance per phase ($L$) = $0.02H$
*   Connection = Star

**2. Calculate Impedance per Phase:**
*   Inductive Reactance ($X_L$) = $2\pi f L$
    $$ X_L = 2 \times 3.14 \times 50 \times 0.02 = 6.28\Omega $$
*   Impedance ($Z_{ph}$) = $R + jX_L = 4 + j6.28 \Omega$
*   Magnitude $|Z_{ph}|$ = $\sqrt{4^2 + 6.28^2} = 7.45 \Omega$
*   Phase Angle ($\phi$) = $\tan^{-1}(\frac{6.28}{4}) = 57.5^\circ$ (Lagging)

**3. Calculate Phase Voltage and Current:**
*   In Star connection: $V_{ph} = \frac{V_L}{\sqrt{3}}$
    $$ V_{ph} = \frac{400}{\sqrt{3}} = 230.94 V $$
*   Phase Current ($I_{ph}$) = $\frac{V_{ph}}{Z_{ph}}$
    $$ I_{ph} = \frac{230.94}{7.45} = 31 A $$
*   Line Current ($I_L$) = $I_{ph} = 31 A$

**4. Calculate Powers:**
*   **Active Power ($P_{3\phi}$)**:
    $$ P = \sqrt{3} V_L I_L \cos\phi $$
    $$ P = \sqrt{3} \times 400 \times 31 \times \cos(57.5^\circ) $$
    $$ P = \sqrt{3} \times 400 \times 31 \times 0.537 = 11.54 kW $$
    *(Alternatively: $3 I_{ph}^2 R = 3 \times 31^2 \times 4 = 11.53 kW$)*

*   **Reactive Power ($Q_{3\phi}$)**:
    $$ Q = \sqrt{3} V_L I_L \sin\phi $$
    $$ Q = \sqrt{3} \times 400 \times 31 \times \sin(57.5^\circ) $$
    $$ Q = 21477 \times 0.843 = 18.11 kVAR $$

**Final Answer:**
*   Active Power = **11.54 kW**
*   Reactive Power = **18.11 kVAR**

### Example 2: Reverse Calculation (Finding Component Values)
**Problem:**
A balanced 3-phase, star connected load of $100kW$ takes a leading current of $80A$ when connected to a 3-phase, $1.1kV, 50Hz$ supply. Find the resistance, impedance, and the capacitance of the load per phase. Also calculate the power factor.

**Solution:**

**1. Given Data:**
*   Active Power ($P$) = $100 kW$
*   Line Current ($I_L$) = $80 A$ (Leading)
*   Line Voltage ($V_L$) = $1.1 kV = 1100 V$
*   Connection = Star

**2. Voltage and Current Relations:**
*   In Star: $I_{ph} = I_L = 80 A$
*   Phase Voltage ($V_{ph}$) = $\frac{1100}{\sqrt{3}} = 635.08 V$

**3. Calculate Impedance ($Z$):**
$$ Z_{ph} = \frac{V_{ph}}{I_{ph}} = \frac{635.08}{80} = 7.94 \Omega $$

**4. Calculate Power Factor and Resistance:**
*   Using Power formula: $P = 3 I_{ph}^2 R$
    $$ 100 \times 10^3 = 3 \times 80^2 \times R $$
    $$ R = \frac{100000}{3 \times 6400} = 5.21 \Omega $$
*   Power Factor ($\cos\phi$) = $\frac{R}{Z} = \frac{5.21}{7.94} = 0.656$ (Leading)

**5. Calculate Capacitance:**
*   Impedance formula: $Z^2 = R^2 + X_C^2$
    $$ X_C = \sqrt{Z^2 - R^2} = \sqrt{7.94^2 - 5.21^2} = \sqrt{63.04 - 27.14} = \sqrt{35.9} $$
    $$ X_C = 5.99 \Omega $$
*   Capacitance ($C$) = $\frac{1}{2\pi f X_C}$
    $$ C = \frac{1}{2 \pi \times 50 \times 5.99} = 531 \mu F $$

**Final Answer:**
*   Resistance = **5.21 $\Omega$**
*   Impedance = **7.94 $\Omega$**
*   Capacitance = **531 $\mu F$**
*   Power Factor = **0.656 Leading**

## 2. Balanced Delta Connected Systems

### Example 3: Different Supply Voltages
**Problem:**
A balanced delta connected load consumes $2 kW$ of power when connected to a 3-phase, $400 V, 50Hz$ supply. The same load when connected to a 3-phase $230V, 50 Hz$ supply, draws a current of $2 A$ at lagging power factor. Determine the load power factor and resistance and inductance per phase.

**Solution:**

**Case 1: 400V Supply (Power Known)**
*   $P_1 = 3 \frac{V_{ph1}^2}{Z} \cos\phi = 2000 W$
*   Delta Connection: $V_{ph1} = V_{L1} = 400V$
*   $3 \times \frac{400^2}{Z} \times \frac{R}{Z} = 2000$
    $$ \frac{480000 R}{Z^2} = 2000 \implies \frac{R}{Z^2} = \frac{1}{240} $$ (Eq 1)

**Case 2: 230V Supply (Current Known)**
*   $V_{L2} = 230V$
*   $I_{L2} = 2A$
*   Delta Connection: $I_{ph2} = \frac{I_{L2}}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} = 1.155 A$
*   Phase Voltage: $V_{ph2} = 230V$
*   Impedance ($Z$) = $\frac{V_{ph2}}{I_{ph2}} = \frac{230}{1.155} = 199.13 \Omega$

**Calculating Parameters:**
*   Substitute $Z$ into Eq 1:
    $$ R = \frac{Z^2}{240} = \frac{199.13^2}{240} = \frac{39652}{240} = 165.22 \Omega $$
*   Reactance ($X_L$) = $\sqrt{Z^2 - R^2} = \sqrt{199.13^2 - 165.22^2} = 111.16 \Omega$
*   Inductance ($L$) = $\frac{X_L}{2\pi f} = \frac{111.16}{314} = 0.354 H$
*   Power Factor ($\cos\phi$) = $\frac{R}{Z} = \frac{165.22}{199.13} = 0.83$ Lagging

**Final Answer:**
*   Power Factor = **0.83 Lag**
*   Resistance = **165.2 $\Omega$**
*   Inductance = **0.354 H**

## 3. Domestic Wiring Calculations

### Example 4: Monthly Bill Calculation
**Problem:**
Calculate the monthly electricity bill for a household with the following daily consumption (30 days):
*   4 LED Bulbs (15W each) for 14 hrs
*   4 Fans (75W each) for 12 hrs
*   1 Geyser (1kW) for 1 hr
*   1 Fridge (100W) for 24 hrs
*   1 TV (50W) for 8 hrs
*   1 Mixer (750W) for 15 mins
*   1 Pump (750W) for 30 mins

**Tariff (Sanctioned Load 5kW):**
*   Fixed Charge: Rs. 100 first kW, Rs. 110/kW additional.
*   Energy Charge:
    *   0-50 units: Rs. 4.15/unit
    *   51-100 units: Rs. 5.60/unit
    *   101-200 units: Rs. 7.15/unit
    *   Above 200: Rs. 8.20/unit
*   Tax: 9% on Energy Charges.

**Solution:**

**1. Calculate Daily Consumption (kWh):**
1.  LEDs: $4 \times 15W \times 14h = 840 Wh$
2.  Fans: $4 \times 75W \times 12h = 3600 Wh$
3.  Geyser: $1000W \times 1h = 1000 Wh$
4.  Fridge: $100W \times 24h = 2400 Wh$
5.  TV: $50W \times 8h = 400 Wh$
6.  Mixer: $750W \times 0.25h = 187.5 Wh$
7.  Pump: $750W \times 0.5h = 375 Wh$

Total per day = $8802.5 Wh = 8.8 kHh$ (Units)

**2. Monthly Consumption:**
$$ Units_{month} = 8.8 \times 30 = 264 \text{ Units} $$ (approx, notes say 245, let's follow the calculation logic strictly based on note inputs if they differ. The note example 54 matches approximately. Let's use 264).

**3. Bill Calculation:**
*   **Fixed Charges:**
    *   1st kW: Rs. 100
    *   Next 4 kW: $4 \times 110 = 440$
    *   Total Fixed = **Rs. 540**

*   **Energy Charges (264 Units):**
    *   0-50: $50 \times 4.15 = 207.5$
    *   51-100: $50 \times 5.60 = 280.0$
    *   101-200: $100 \times 7.15 = 715.0$
    *   201-264: $64 \times 8.20 = 524.8$
    *   Total Energy = **Rs. 1727.3**

*   **Tax (9% on Energy):**
    *   $0.09 \times 1727.3 = 155.45$

**Total Bill:**
$$ 540 + 1727.3 + 155.45 = \text{Rs. } 2422.75 $$
