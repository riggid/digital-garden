# Unit 3 Q&A: Three Phase Systems & Installations

## 1. Three Phase Balanced Systems

*   **1. Define "Phase Sequence" with respect to a three-phase system.**
    *   **Answer**: Phase Sequence is the order in which the three-phase voltages attain their peak positive values. The standard sequence is R-Y-B. See [[Semester 1/Electrical/Unit 3/Core Notes#11-generation-of-balanced-three-phase-emfs\|Core Notes]].

*   **2. Define a "Balanced Three Phase System" of voltages.**
    *   **Answer**: A system where the three phase voltages are equal in magnitude and displaced from each other by 120 electrical degrees. See [[Semester 1/Electrical/Unit 3/Core Notes#11-generation-of-balanced-three-phase-emfs\|Core Notes]].

*   **3. What is the relation between Line and Phase voltages in a Star Connected system?**
    *   **Answer**: Line voltage is $\sqrt{3}$ times the Phase voltage and leads it by 30°. ($V_L = \sqrt{3}V_{ph}$). See [[Semester 1/Electrical/Unit 3/Core Notes#122-relationships-in-star-connection\|Core Notes]].

*   **4. What is the relation between Line and Phase currents in a Delta Connected system?**
    *   **Answer**: Line current is $\sqrt{3}$ times the Phase current and lags it by 30°. ($I_L = \sqrt{3}I_{ph}$). See [[Semester 1/Electrical/Unit 3/Core Notes#131-relationships-in-delta-connection\|Core Notes]].

*   **5. How many coils are present in a wattmeter and what are they called?**
    *   **Answer**: Two coils: The **Current Coil (CC)** (connected in series with the load) and the **Pressure/Voltage Coil (PC)** (connected across the supply). See [[Semester 1/Electrical/Unit 3/Core Notes#15-measurement-of-power-two-wattmeter-method\|Core Notes]].

*   **6. In the Two Wattmeter method, what does it indicate if one wattmeter reads zero?**
    *   **Answer**: It indicates that the power factor of the load is exactly **0.5 (Lagging)**, meaning the phase angle is 60°. See [[Semester 1/Electrical/Unit 3/Core Notes#151-variation-of-wattmeter-readings-with-power-factor\|Core Notes]].

*   **7. In the Two Wattmeter method, what does it indicate if one wattmeter gives a negative reading?**
    *   **Answer**: It indicates that the power factor is **less than 0.5** (phase angle > 60°). The connections of the pressure coil must be reversed to take the reading, which is then subtracted. See [[Semester 1/Electrical/Unit 3/Core Notes#151-variation-of-wattmeter-readings-with-power-factor\|Core Notes]].

## 2. Electrical Installations

*   **8. Write a short note on the necessity of earthing.**
    *   **Answer**: Earthing protects human life from electric shock, protects equipment from overvoltage/lightning, and provides a safe path for fault currents to blow the fuse/trip the breaker. See [[Semester 1/Electrical/Unit 3/Core Notes#25-earthing-grounding\|Core Notes]].

*   **9. Discuss the working of an MCB.**
    *   **Answer**: proper MCB uses a bimetallic strip for thermal overload protection (slow, small overcurrents) and a magnetic trip coil for short circuit protection (fast, large currents). See [[Semester 1/Electrical/Unit 3/Core Notes#22-miniature-circuit-breaker-mcb\|Core Notes]].

*   **10. Discuss the working of an RCCB.**
    *   **Answer**: An RCCB operates on the principle of Kirchhoff's Current Law, monitoring the vector sum of line and neutral currents. If the sum is not zero (indicating leakage to earth), it trips the circuit. See [[Semester 1/Electrical/Unit 3/Core Notes#23-earth-leakage-circuit-breaker-elcb-rccb\|Core Notes]].

*   **11. Differentiate between a Wire and a Cable.**
    *   **Answer**: A wire is a single electrical conductor (solid or stranded), while a cable consists of one or more insulated conductors grouped together in a sheath. See [[Semester 1/Electrical/Unit 3/Core Notes#26-wires-and-cables\|Core Notes]].

*   **12. List the components of a typical earthing system.**
    *   **Answer**: Earth Electrode (Plate/Pipe), Earthing Lead, and Earth Continuity Conductor. See [[Semester 1/Electrical/Unit 3/Core Notes#25-earthing-grounding\|Core Notes]].
