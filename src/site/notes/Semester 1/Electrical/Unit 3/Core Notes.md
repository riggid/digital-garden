# Unit 3: Three Phase Balanced Systems & Electrical Installations

## 1. Three Phase Balanced Systems

### 1.1 Generation of Balanced Three Phase EMFs
A **balanced three-phase system** of EMFs is a set of three alternating electromotive forces (EMFs) that are:
1.  **Equal in amplitude** (magnitude).
2.  Displaced in **phase** from one another by **120°** (electrical degrees).

If the three phases are labeled R (Red), Y (Yellow), and B (Blue), the instantaneous voltages can be represented as:
$$ e_R(t) = E_m \sin(\omega t) $$
$$ e_Y(t) = E_m \sin(\omega t - 120^\circ) $$
$$ e_B(t) = E_m \sin(\omega t - 240^\circ) $$

These balanced EMFs are generated by a **Three Phase Generator** (often called an Alternator).
*   **Stator**: The stationary part consisting of three coils (R, Y, B) physically displaced by 120° in space.
*   **Rotor**: The rotating part consisting of electromagnets excited by DC, driven by a prime mover (turbine, engine).

**Principle of Operation**:
As the rotor rotates, the magnetic flux links with the stator coils.
*   When the North pole faces Coil R, maximum positive EMF is induced.
*   When the rotor moves 120°, the North pole faces Coil Y, inducing maximum EMF in Y (lagging R by 120°).
*   Similarly for Coil B (lagging R by 240°).

**Phase Sequence**:
The order in which the three-phase voltages attain their peak positive values. The standard sequence is **RYB**.

### 1.2 Balanced Star (WYE) Connected System
In a **Star ($\mathbf{Y}$)** connection, similar terminals (e.g., all "finish" ends) of the three phases are connected together to form a common point called the **Neutral (N)**.

#### 1.2.1 Voltage and Current Definitions
*   **Phase Voltage ($V_{ph}$)**: Voltage across the terminals of a single phase winding (e.g., $V_{RN}, V_{YN}, V_{BN}$).
*   **Line Voltage ($V_L$)**: Voltage between any two line conductors (e.g., $V_{RY}, V_{YB}, V_{BR}$).
*   **Phase Current ($I_{ph}$)**: Current flowing through a phase winding.
*   **Line Current ($I_L$)**: Current flowing through the line conductors.

#### 1.2.2 Relationships in Star Connection
1.  **Current Relation**: The current flowing through the line is the same as the current flowing through importance phase winding.
    $$ I_L = I_{ph} $$
2.  **Voltage Relation**: The line voltages are the vector difference of the phase voltages. Applying KVL:
    $$ \vec{V}_{RY} = \vec{V}_{RN} - \vec{V}_{YN} $$
    Through phasor analysis (vector subtraction of two vectors of equal magnitude $V_{ph}$ displaced by 120°):
    $$ V_L = \sqrt{3} V_{ph} $$
    *   **Phase Relationship**: The line voltage **leads** the corresponding phase voltage by **30°**.

### 1.3 Balanced Delta (Mesh) Connected System
In a **Delta ($\mathbf{\Delta}$)** connection, the coils are connected end-to-end (R finish to Y start, Y finish to B start, etc.) to form a closed loop. There is no neutral point.

#### 1.3.1 Relationships in Delta Connection
1.  **Voltage Relation**: The voltage across the lines is directly across the phase windings.
    $$ V_L = V_{ph} $$
2.  **Current Relation**: The line currents are the vector difference of the phase currents. Applying KCL at a node:
    $$ \vec{I}_R = \vec{I}_1 - \vec{I}_3 $$
    Through phasor analysis:
    $$ I_L = \sqrt{3} I_{ph} $$
    *   **Phase Relationship**: The line current **lags** the corresponding phase current by **30°**.

### 1.4 Power Relations in Balanced Systems
The power calculations are identical for both Star and Delta balanced systems when expressed in terms of line quantities.

1.  **Active Power ($P$)**: The real power consumed by the resistive part of the load.
    $$ P_{3\phi} = 3 \times P_{1\phi} = 3 V_{ph} I_{ph} \cos\phi $$
    In terms of line quantities:
    $$ P_{3\phi} = \sqrt{3} V_L I_L \cos\phi $$
    *(Unit: Watts, kW)*

2.  **Reactive Power ($Q$)**: The power exchanged by reactive components (inductors/capacitors).
    $$ Q_{3\phi} = 3 V_{ph} I_{ph} \sin\phi $$
    In terms of line quantities:
    $$ Q_{3\phi} = \sqrt{3} V_L I_L \sin\phi $$
    *(Unit: VAR, kVAR)*

3.  **Apparent Power ($S$)**: The total power capacity.
    $$ S_{3\phi} = 3 V_{ph} I_{ph} $$
    In terms of line quantities:
    $$ S_{3\phi} = \sqrt{3} V_L I_L $$
    Also:
    $$ S_{3\phi} = \sqrt{P^2 + Q^2} $$
    *(Unit: VA, kVA)*

> **Note**: $\phi$ is the **phase angle** (angle between phase voltage and phase current), not the angle between line values. $\cos\phi$ is the **Power Factor**.

### 1.5 Measurement of Power: Two Wattmeter Method
Two wattmeters are sufficient to measure the total three-phase active power in a three-wire system (Star or Delta), balanced or unbalanced.

> Two Wattmeter method with phase A common

*   **Current Coils (CC)**: Connected in series with two of the lines (e.g., R and B).
*   **Pressure Coils (PC)**: Connected between the respective line and the third common line (e.g., Y).

**Wattmeter Readings ($W_1$ and $W_2$):**
Assuming balanced load and lagging power factor $\phi$:
$$ W_1 = V_L I_L \cos(30^\circ + \phi) $$
$$ W_2 = V_L I_L \cos(30^\circ - \phi) $$

**Total Power**:
$$ P_{3\phi} = W_1 + W_2 = \sqrt{3} V_L I_L \cos\phi $$
*   **Derivation**:
    $$ W_1 + W_2 = V_L I_L [\cos(30^\circ + \phi) + \cos(30^\circ - \phi)] $$
    Using $\cos(A+B) + \cos(A-B) = 2\cos A \cos B$:
    $$ = V_L I_L [2 \cos 30^\circ \cos \phi] = V_L I_L [2 (\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}) \cos \phi] = \sqrt{3} V_L I_L \cos \phi $$

**Reactive Power Calculation**:
$$ Q_{3\phi} = \sqrt{3} (W_2 - W_1) $$
*   **Derivation**:
    $$ W_2 - W_1 = V_L I_L [\cos(30^\circ - \phi) - \cos(30^\circ + \phi)] $$
    Using $\cos(A-B) - \cos(A+B) = 2\sin A \sin B$:
    $$ = V_L I_L [2 \sin 30^\circ \sin \phi] = V_L I_L [2 (0.5) \sin \phi] = V_L I_L \sin \phi $$
    Multiplying by $\sqrt{3}$ gives $Q_{3\phi}$.

**Power Factor Calculation**:
$$ \tan\phi = \frac{\sqrt{3}(W_2 - W_1)}{W_1 + W_2} $$
$$ \cos\phi = \cos\left( \tan^{-1} \left( \frac{\sqrt{3}(W_2 - W_1)}{W_1 + W_2} \right) \right) $$

#### 1.5.1 Variation of Wattmeter Readings with Power Factor

| Phase Angle ($\phi$) | Power Factor ($\cos\phi$) | $W_1$ Reading | $W_2$ Reading | Comments |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0°** | **1 (Unity)** | Positive | Positive | $W_1 = W_2$ |
| **0° < $\phi$ < 60°** | **1 > p.f. > 0.5** | Positive | Positive | $W_2 > W_1$ |
| **60°** | **0.5** | **Zero** | Positive | $W_1 = 0$, $W_2 = P_{total}$ |
| **60° < $\phi$ < 90°** | **< 0.5** | **Negative** | Positive | $W_1$ reads negative (reverse connections to read) |

## 2. Electrical Installations

### 2.1 Protective Devices: Fuses
A **Fuse** is a sacrificial device that protects a circuit from overcurrent and short circuits by melting a conductive element.

**Characteristics**:
*   **Current Rating**: Max current it can carry without blowing.
*   **Voltage Rating**: Max voltage it can handle.
*   **Fusing Current**: Minimum current at which the element melts.
*   **Breaking Capacity**: Max short circuit current it can interrupt safely.

**Types of Fuses**:
1.  **Rewireable (Kit-Kat) Fuse**:
    *   Consists of a porcelain base and a removable carrier holding the fuse wire.
    *   Simple, cheap, used in domestic wiring.
    *   Disadvantage: Unreliable calibration, slow operation.
2.  **Cartridge Fuse**:
    *   Totally enclosed. Element is inside a container (glass/ceramic).
    *   Prevents arc flash. Used in appliances and industries.
3.  **HRC (High Rupturing Capacity) Fuse**:
    *   Cartridge type filled with chemical powder (quartz/sand) to quench the arc.
    *   **Inverse time characteristic**: Faster clearing for higher fault currents.
    *   Used for high currents and back-up protection.
4.  **Drop Out Fuse**:
    *   Used in high voltage distribution. The fuse tube drops down under gravity when the element melts, providing visual isolation.

### 2.2 Miniature Circuit Breaker (MCB)
Examples of modern protection devices replacing fuses in low voltage networks.
*   **Working**: Uses a **bimetallic strip** for overload protection (thermal effect) and a **solenoid/trip coil** for short circuit protection (magnetic effect).
*   **Advantages over Fuse**:
    1.  Automatically switches off (doesn't destroy itself).
    2.  Easy identification of faulty circuit (knob trips).
    3.  Quick restoration (just switch ON).
    4.  Safer handling.

### 2.3 Earth Leakage Circuit Breaker (ELCB) & RCCB
Devices designed to protect against **electric shock** and earth leakage currents.

1.  **Voltage ELCB (Old Type)**:
    *   Detects a voltage rise on the metal body of equipment.
    *   Requires a dedicated earth wire connection.
    *   **Disadvantage**: Won't trip if the earth wire is faulty or if shock is direct.
2.  **RCCB (Residual Current Circuit Breaker) / RCD**:
    *   **Current operated**.
    *   **Principle**: Kirchhoff's Current Law. It monitors the balance between **Phase (Line) current** and **Neutral current**.
    *   In normal operation, $I_{in} = I_{out}$.
    *   If a fault occurs (current leaks to earth/body), $I_{in} \neq I_{out}$. The difference (residual current) is detected by a toroidal transformer, which trips the relay.
    *   **Sensitivity**: typically 30mA (human safety) or 100mA (fire safety).

### 2.4 Molded Case Circuit Breaker (MCCB)
*   Similar to MCB but for higher current ratings (63A to 1000A).
*   Adjustable trip settings.
*   Used in industrial applications.

### 2.5 Earthing (Grounding)
Connecting metallic parts of electrical equipment to the general mass of the earth.

**Necessity**:
1.  **Safety**: Protects humans from shock by providing a low-resistance path for fault currents.
2.  **Protection**: Protects equipment from overvoltages and lightning.
3.  **Potential Reference**: Maintains the neutral at zero potential.

**Components**:
*   **Earth Electrode**: Pot/Plate/Rod buried underground.
*   **Earthing Lead**: Wire connecting electrode to the distribution board.
*   **Earth Continuity Conductor**: Wire connecting all metallic parts of installation to the earthing lead.

**Procedure for Pipe/Plate Earthing**:
1.  Dig a pit (min 3m deep for pipe).
2.  Place the electrode (GI pipe or Copper Plate).
3.  Fill alternating layers of **Charcoal and Salt** around it (to retain moisture and lower resistance).
4.  Connect the earthing lead securely.
5.  Maintain moisture by watering through a funnel.
6.  Resistance should be **< 1 $\Omega$**.

### 2.6 Wires and Cables
*   **Wire**: Single conductor.
*   **Cable**: Group of insulated conductors sheathed together.

**Common Types**:
*   **VIR (Vulcanised Indian Rubber)**: Old type, cotton braided.
*   **TRS (Tough Rubber Sheathed) / CTS**: Rubber coated, mechanical protection.
*   **PVC (Poly Vinyl Chloride)**: Most common. Durable, moisture/chemical resistant, high dielectric strength.
*   **Weather Proof**: For outdoor use.
*   **MICC (Mineral Insulated Copper Covered)**: For high temperature/ hazardous areas.

**Cable Construction**:
1.  **Conductor**: Copper/Aluminum.
2.  **Insulation**: Paper, PVC, XLPE.
3.  **Inner Sheath**: Lead/Aluminum (protects from moisture).
4.  **Armouring**: Steel wire/tape (mechanical protection).
5.  **Outer Sheath**: PVC/Rubber (overall protection).

### 2.7 Calculation of Energy Consumption
Electrical energy is measured in **Units** or **kWh** (Kilowatt-hour).
$$ \text{Energy (kWh)} = \frac{\text{Power (Watts)} \times \text{Time (Hours)}}{1000} $$

**Tariff Calculation**:
Electricity bills usually consist of:
1.  **Fixed Charges**: Based on sanctioned load ($kW$).
2.  **Energy Charges**: Slab-based rate per unit consumed.
3.  **Fuel Adjustment Charges (FAC)**: Variable cost.
4.  **Tax**: Percentage of the total bill.
