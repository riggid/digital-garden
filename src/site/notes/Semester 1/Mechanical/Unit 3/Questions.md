# Unit 3: Manufacturing Techniques and Metal Joining Processes - Practice Questions

---

## 1. Introduction to Manufacturing Processes: Classification and Rationale

**1. Define manufacturing broadly and explain why an engineer needs a detailed understanding of manufacturing processes.**
*   **Answer**: Manufacturing is converting raw materials into finished products. Engineers need this knowledge to assess process capabilities, design for manufacturing feasibility, select cost-effective processes, and ensure product quality. See [[Semester 1/Mechanical/Unit 3/Core Notes#11-defining-manufacturing-and-its-engineering-imperative\|Core Notes.md]].

**2. Classify manufacturing processes into their five main groups and provide examples for each.**
*   **Answer**: Primary shaping (Casting, Forming), Machining (Turning, Milling), Surface finishing (Buffing, Lapping), Joining (Welding, Soldering), and Processes affecting change in properties (Heat treatment, Shot peening). See [[Semester 1/Mechanical/Unit 3/Core Notes#12-the-five-pillars-of-manufacturing-classification\|Core Notes.md]].

## 2. Metal Casting Processes: Sand Casting Fundamentals and Precision Methods

**3. Explain the metal casting process and define "founding" and "casting" in this context. What is the principal casting process?**
*   **Answer**: Metal casting involves pouring molten metal into a refractory mould to solidify into a desired shape. "Founding" is the entire process; "casting" is the solidified object. **Sand casting** is the principal process. See [[Semester 1/Mechanical/Unit 3/Core Notes#21-introduction-to-casting-founding\|Core Notes.md]].

**4. Define the following casting terms with respect to a sand mould: cope, drag, pattern, and parting line.**
*   **Answer**: **Cope** (upper flask), **Drag** (lower flask), **Pattern** (replica of final object with allowances), **Parting line** (dividing line between flasks/pattern halves). See [[Semester 1/Mechanical/Unit 3/Core Notes#221-moulding-box-and-pattern-media\|Core Notes.md]].

**5. Describe the functions of facing sand, moulding sand, and backing sand in the sand moulding procedure.**
*   **Answer**: **Facing sand** (carbonaceous) provides good surface finish. **Moulding sand** (fresh silica, clay, moisture) makes the cavity. **Backing sand** (used, burnt sand) forms bulk of mould. See [[Semester 1/Mechanical/Unit 3/Core Notes#23-detailed-sand-moulding-procedure\|Core Notes.md]].

**6. Explain the roles of the pouring basin, sprue, runner, and gate in the gating system of a sand mould.**
*   **Answer**: **Pouring basin** (initial pour), **Sprue** (vertical passage, flow control), **Runner** (horizontal passageways, flow regulation), **Gate** (entry point into mould cavity). See [[Semester 1/Mechanical/Unit 3/Core Notes#222-gating-and-feeding-system-components\|Core Notes.md]].

**7. What is a riser in casting, and why is it essential?**
*   **Answer**: A **riser** is a molten metal reservoir that feeds liquid metal into the mould cavity to compensate for liquid shrinkage during solidification, preventing shrinkage cavities. See [[Semester 1/Mechanical/Unit 3/Core Notes#222-gating-and-feeding-system-components\|Core Notes.md]].

**8. Explain the concept of "Pattern Allowances" and state its purpose. List at least three types of pattern allowances.**
*   **Answer**: Modifications to pattern dimensions to compensate for casting phenomena. Purpose: Ensure final product meets specifications. Types: **Shrinkage**, **Finish/Machining**, **Draft**, **Shake**, **Distortion** allowances. See [[Semester 1/Mechanical/Unit 3/Core Notes#25-pattern-allowances-correcting-for-process-imperfections\|Core Notes.md]].

**9. Differentiate between "liquid shrinkage" and "solid shrinkage" in casting. How are they addressed?**
*   **Answer**: **Liquid shrinkage** is volume reduction during liquid-to-solid phase change (addressed by **risers**). **Solid shrinkage** is volume reduction during solid cooling (addressed by **shrinkage allowance** on pattern). See [[Semester 1/Mechanical/Unit 3/Core Notes#251-shrinkage-liquid-shrinkage-vs-solid-shrinkage\|Core Notes.md]].

**10. Explain "Draft Allowance" and "Shake Allowance" in pattern making.**
*   **Answer**: **Draft allowance** (tapering vertical faces) eases pattern withdrawal, preventing mould damage. **Shake allowance** (pattern dimensions reduced) compensates for mould cavity enlargement from rapping pattern before withdrawal. See [[Semester 1/Mechanical/Unit 3/Core Notes#252-draft-allowance\|Core Notes.md]] and [[Semester 1/Mechanical/Unit 3/Core Notes#253-shake-allowance\|Core Notes.md]].

**11. Describe the "Distortion Allowance" in pattern making. Why is it necessary, and how can it be implemented?**
*   **Answer**: Pattern pre-deformation in the opposite direction of expected distortion. Necessary because solidified metal is weak and prone to warping, especially for complex or thin sections. Implemented via trial-and-error by distorting the pattern itself. See [[Semester 1/Mechanical/Unit 3/Core Notes#254-distortion-allowance\|Core Notes.md]].

**12. Differentiate between a "Solid or Single Piece Pattern" and a "Split Pattern," including their applications.**
*   **Answer**: **Solid pattern** (single piece) for simple jobs, typically in drag (small-scale/prototype). **Split pattern** (two parts) for complex contours/depth, each half in cope and drag (easier withdrawal). See [[Semester 1/Mechanical/Unit 3/Core Notes#221-moulding-box-and-pattern-media\|Core Notes.md]].

**13. Describe "Cope and Drag Pattern" and "Match Plate Pattern." For what production scenarios are they typically used?**
*   **Answer**: **Cope and Drag pattern** (halves on separate plates with gating) for heavy castings/continuous production. **Match Plate pattern** (halves and gating on single plate) for small, accurate, large-scale production. See [[Semester 1/Mechanical/Unit 3/Core Notes#221-moulding-box-and-pattern-media\|Core Notes.md]]. *(Note: These definitions are implied from the OCR Q&A but not explicitly detailed in the core notes text provided. They would ideally be in a "Types of Patterns" subsection)*

**14. Explain "Loose Piece Pattern" and "Sweep Pattern." Give an example for the application of a sweep pattern.**
*   **Answer**: **Loose Piece pattern** (obstructing contour held loosely) for complex withdrawal (expensive, skilled). **Sweep pattern** (plane sweep generates axi-symmetrical shapes) for very large castings (e.g., bells in pit moulds). See [[Semester 1/Mechanical/Unit 3/Core Notes#221-moulding-box-and-pattern-media\|Core Notes.md]]. *(Note: These definitions are implied from the OCR Q&A but not explicitly detailed in the core notes text provided. They would ideally be in a "Types of Patterns" subsection)*

**15. Describe three key properties of moulding materials: refractoriness, permeability, and collapsibility.**
*   **Answer**: **Refractoriness** (withstands high molten metal temps), **Permeability** (allows gases to escape), **Collapsibility** (breaks down after solidification for free contraction). See [[Semester 1/Mechanical/Unit 3/Core Notes#24-properties-of-moulding-materials-and-quality-control\|Core Notes.md]].

**16. Explain "blow holes" and "pin hole porosity" as gas defects in casting. What are their main causes?**
*   **Answer**: **Blow holes** (internal/surface cavities) from trapped steam/gases (low permeability, insufficient venting). **Pin hole porosity** (small elongated holes) from dissolved hydrogen (high pouring temperature). See [[Semester 1/Mechanical/Unit 3/Core Notes#261-gas-defects\|Core Notes.md]].

**17. Describe three moulding material defects: metal penetration, swell, and drop.**
*   **Answer**: **Metal penetration** (molten metal enters sand gaps, rough surface) from coarse sand. **Swell** (mould wall moves creating enlargement) from faulty ramming. **Drop** (loose sand falls into cavity) from improper ramming of cope. See [[Semester 1/Mechanical/Unit 3/Core Notes#262-mould-material-defects\|Core Notes.md]].

**18. Differentiate between "mis runs" and "cold shuts" as pouring metal defects. What are the common remedies?**
*   **Answer**: **Mis run** (incomplete cavity fill) and **Cold shut** (two metal streams fail to fuse) are both from low molten metal fluidity or thin sections. Remedies: Increase fluidity (composition/temp), proper design. See [[Semester 1/Mechanical/Unit 3/Core Notes#263-pouring-metal-defects\|Core Notes.md]].

**19. Briefly describe the process of Precision Investment Casting.**
*   **Answer**: Lost wax process: Wax pattern (die injection), tree assembly, ceramic shell investment, dewaxing, pre-heating, molten metal pouring, cooling, and shakeout. Known for high precision/finish. See [[Semester 1/Mechanical/Unit 3/Core Notes#27-special-casting-precision-investment-casting-lost-wax\|Core Notes.md]].

## 3. Metal Forming Processes: Bulk Deformation and Shaping

**20. What are forming processes in manufacturing? Discuss their general principle and list their advantages.**
*   **Answer**: Solid-state processes using force to plastically deform metal with minimal waste. Advantages: Faster production, economical, improved mechanical properties. See [[Semester 1/Mechanical/Unit 3/Core Notes#31-definition-and-thermodynamic-classification\|Core Notes.md]].

**21. Differentiate between hot working and cold working processes, highlighting their advantages and limitations.**
*   **Answer**: **Hot working** (above $T_{rec}$): high deformation, no strain hardening. **Cold working** (below $T_{rec}$): limited deformation, increases strength/hardness. See [[Semester 1/Mechanical/Unit 3/Core Notes#32-hot-working-vs-cold-working-analysis\|Core Notes.md]].

## 4. Metal Joining Processes: Welding and Allied Techniques

**22. Describe the resistance welding process. Explain the principle of heat generation in resistance welding and state its formula.**
*   **Answer**: Joining with heat and pressure, no filler/flux. Heat from electrical resistance at joint interface: $H=I^2Rt$. See [[Semester 1/Mechanical/Unit 3/Core Notes#412-welding-definition-and-methods\|Core Notes.md]]. *(Note: Formula $H=I^2Rt$ is present in Q&A content but not explicitly in provided OCR section for resistance welding. However, it is an essential part of the answer, so it's good to include.)*

**23. Explain the principle of Metal Inert Gas (MIG) welding. List its advantages and limitations.**
*   **Answer**: Consumable wire electrode, arc shielded by inert gas/CO2. High deposition rate. Advantages: High speed, good quality, no slag. Limitations: Higher equipment cost, outdoor sensitivity. See [[Semester 1/Mechanical/Unit 3/Core Notes#441-metal-inert-gas-arc-welding-mig--gas-metal-arc-welding-gmaw\|Core Notes.md]].

**24. Explain the principle of Tungsten Inert Gas (TIG) welding. List its advantages and limitations.**
*   **Answer**: Non-consumable tungsten electrode, arc shielded by inert gas. Filler added externally. Advantages: Smooth/sound welds, no flux, automatable. Limitations: High inert gas cost, slow speed for thick plates. See [[Semester 1/Mechanical/Unit 3/Core Notes#442-tungsten-inert-gas-tig-welding--gas-tungsten-arc-welding-gtaw\|Core Notes.md]].

**25. What is Laser Beam Welding (LBW)? Describe its principle and list its key characteristics.**
*   **Answer**: Fusion welding using a highly concentrated laser beam as heat source. Principle: Intense laser energy melts and fuses joint. Characteristics: High power density, focused heat, narrow/deep welds, high welding rates. See [[Semester 1/Mechanical/Unit 3/Core Notes#412-welding-definition-and-methods\|Core Notes.md]]. *(Note: LBW is not explicitly covered in the OCR notes but it's in the Q&A. I will add a full section for LBW.)*

**26. Explain the concept of "Conduction Mode Welding" and "Keyhole Mode Welding" in Laser Beam Welding.**
*   **Answer**: **Conduction mode** (lower power density): surface melting, shallow wide welds. **Keyhole mode** (higher power density): material vaporization, plasma keyhole, deep narrow welds. See [[Semester 1/Mechanical/Unit 3/Core Notes#412-welding-definition-and-methods\|Core Notes.md]]. *(Note: These definitions are implied from the Q&A but would be placed into the added LBW section.)*

**27. List five advantages and five disadvantages of Laser Beam Welding.**
*   **Answer**: Advantages: High precision, minimal HAZ, high speed, deep/narrow welds, non-contact. Disadvantages: High equipment/maintenance cost, strict joint fit-up, limited penetration for thick materials, material sensitivity. See [[Semester 1/Mechanical/Unit 3/Core Notes#412-welding-definition-and-methods\|Core Notes.md]]. *(Note: These are implied from the Q&A but would be placed into the added LBW section.)*

**28. Describe "Cracks" and "Porosity" as common welding defects. What are their causes?**
*   **Answer**: **Cracks** (discontinuities, hot/cold) from improper welding/solidification, high stress/cooling rate, wrong filler. **Porosity** (voids/holes) from gas entrapment (insufficient shielding, contamination). See [[Semester 1/Mechanical/Unit 3/Core Notes#45-welding-defects-and-integrity-compromise\|Core Notes.md]].

**29. Define soldering and brazing. State one key difference between them based on filler metal melting point.**
*   **Answer**: **Soldering** (filler < 450°C), **Brazing** (filler > 450°C but < base metal). Both use capillary action but differ in joint strength and suitability for temp service. See [[Semester 1/Mechanical/Unit 3/Core Notes#461-soldering\|Core Notes.md]] and [[Semester 1/Mechanical/Unit 3/Core Notes#462-brazing\|Core Notes.md]].

**30. List five advantages of brazing as a joining process.**
*   **Answer**: Joins dissimilar metals, less preheating/distortion, faster speed, no spatter, little finishing, preserves base metal properties. See [[Semester 1/Mechanical/Unit 3/Core Notes#464-advantages-of-brazing\|Core Notes.md]].
