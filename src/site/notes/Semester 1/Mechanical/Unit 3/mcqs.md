## Metal Casting Processes

### Question 1
In sand casting, the primary function of a **riser** is to:
*   A) Feed molten metal to the casting to compensate for solid shrinkage
*   B) Feed molten metal to the casting to compensate for liquid shrinkage
*   C) Allow gases to escape from the mould
*   D) Support the core

<details>
<summary><strong>Check Answer</strong></summary>

> **Correct Answer: B) Feed molten metal to the casting to compensate for liquid shrinkage**
> Risers act as reservoirs to prevent shrinkage cavities during solidification. Solid shrinkage is handled by pattern allowance.
</details>

### Question 2
The **Draft Allowance** is provided on patterns mainly to:
*   A) Compensate for metal contraction
*   B) Strengthen the pattern
*   C) Facilitate easy withdrawal of the pattern from the mould without damaging walls
*   D) Improve surface finish

<details>
<summary><strong>Check Answer</strong></summary>

> **Correct Answer: C) Facilitate easy withdrawal of the pattern from the mould without damaging walls**
> Tapering vertical faces reduces friction during removal.
</details>

### Question 3
Which casting defect is characterized by internal voids caused by entrapped gases?
*   A) Hot Tears
*   B) Misrun
*   C) Blow Holes
*   D) Metal Penetration

<details>
<summary><strong>Check Answer</strong></summary>

> **Correct Answer: C) Blow Holes**
> Caused by moisture or low permeability trapping steam/gas.
</details>

## Metal Forming Processes

### Question 4
Hot working of metals is carried out:
*   A) Below the recrystallization temperature
*   B) At the recrystallization temperature
*   C) Above the recrystallization temperature
*   D) At room temperature

<details>
<summary><strong>Check Answer</strong></summary>

> **Correct Answer: C) Above the recrystallization temperature**
> This allows for large deformations without strain hardening.
</details>

### Question 5
In which type of extrusion is friction between the billet and container walls minimized or eliminated?
*   A) Direct Extrusion
*   B) Forward Extrusion
*   C) Indirect (Backward) Extrusion
*   D) Impact Extrusion

<details>
<summary><strong>Check Answer</strong></summary>

> **Correct Answer: C) Indirect (Backward) Extrusion**
> The billet remains stationary relative to the container.
</details>

## Joining Processes

### Question 6
The primary difference between Soldering and Brazing is:
*   A) Composition of filler metal
*   B) Melting point of filler metal (Below vs Above 450°C)
*   C) Strength of joint
*   D) Corrosion resistance

<details>
<summary><strong>Check Answer</strong></summary>

> **Correct Answer: B) Melting point of filler metal (Below vs Above 450°C)**
> Soldering < 450°C; Brazing > 450°C.
</details>

### Question 7
Which welding process uses a **non-consumable tungsten electrode**?
*   A) MIG Welding (GMAW)
*   B) TIG Welding (GTAW)
*   C) Shielded Metal Arc Welding (SMAW)
*   D) Submerged Arc Welding

<details>
<summary><strong>Check Answer</strong></summary>

> **Correct Answer: B) TIG Welding (GTAW)**
> TIG uses Tungsten electrodes which do not melt; filler is added separately if needed.
</details>

### Question 8
In DC Welding, **Straight Polarity (DCSP)** or Electrode Negative results in:
*   A) Deeper penetration
*   B) Faster electrode melting and shallower penetration
*   C) Slower electrode melting
*   D) Unstable arc

<details>
<summary><strong>Check Answer</strong></summary>

> **Correct Answer: B) Faster electrode melting and shallower penetration**
> Heat is concentrated on the electrode (cathode), increasing deposition rate but reducing penetration depth.
</details>

### Question 9
Precision Investment Casting is also known as:
*   A) Die Casting
*   B) Centrifugal Casting
*   C) Lost Wax Process
*   D) Shell Moulding

<details>
<summary><strong>Check Answer</strong></summary>

> **Correct Answer: C) Lost Wax Process**
> It uses an expendable wax pattern that is melted out of the ceramic shell.
</details>

### Question 10
Which oxy-acetylene flame is used for welding high carbon steels to prevent oxidation?
*   A) Neutral Flame
*   B) Oxidizing Flame
*   C) Reducing (Carburizing) Flame
*   D) Retarding Flame

<details>
<summary><strong>Check Answer</strong></summary>

> **Correct Answer: C) Reducing (Carburizing) Flame**
> Contains excess acetylene, preventing oxidation of the metal.
</details>
