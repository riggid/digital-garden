## 📝 Selected Previous Year Questions with Solutions

### 1. Casting and Manufacturing

### 1. Sand Casting Steps
**Question:** Explain the steps involved in making a sand mould with a neat flowchart or diagram.

**Answer:**
**Steps**:
1.  **Pattern Making**: Create a replica of the part (with allowances).
2.  **Core Making**: Prepare cores for hollow sections.
3.  **Moulding**: Place pattern in sand box (flask), pack sand around it (ramming).
4.  **Pattern Removal**: Remove pattern carefully, leaving a cavity.
5.  **Gating System**: Cut channels (runner, riser, gate) for molten metal flow.
6.  **Pouring**: Pour molten metal into the cavity.
7.  **Cooling & Solidification**: Allow metal to solidify.
8.  **Shakeout & Cleaning**: Break mould, remove casting, clean sand (fettling).

### 2. Casting Defects
**Question:** List common casting defects (e.g., Blow holes, Shrinkage cavities). Explain their causes and remedies.

**Answer:**
1.  **Blow Holes**: Gas bubbles trapped inside. *Cause*: Moist sand, poor venting. *Remedy*: Proper venting, dry sand.
2.  **Shrinkage Cavities**: Voids due to contraction. *Cause*: Improper riser design. *Remedy*: Use adequate risers to feed liquid metal.
3.  **Misrun**: Metal freezes before filling cavity. *Cause*: Low pouring temp. *Remedy*: Increase pouring temp.

### 3. Patterns & Allowances
**Question:** What is a Pattern? detailed the different types of allowances provided on patterns.

**Answer:**
-   **Pattern**: A replica of the object to be cast, used to create the mould cavity.
-   **Allowances**:
    1.  **Shrinkage**: To compensate for metal contraction during cooling. (Pattern made slightly larger).
    2.  **Draft**: Taper given to vertical walls for easy removal of pattern without damaging mould.
    3.  **Machining**: Extra material added to be removed later to get good finish.

### 2. Joining Processes

### 1. Welding Differences
**Question:** Differentiate between Arc Welding and Gas Welding.

**Answer:**
-   **Arc Welding**: Heat source is an Electric Arc ($>3000^\circ C$). Filler rod may/may not be used. Stronger joint.
-   **Gas Welding**: Heat source is flame from burning gases (Oxy-acetylene, $~3200^\circ C$). Filler rod usually used. Slower process.

### 2. Soldering vs Brazing vs Welding
**Question:** Compare and contrast Soldering, Brazing, and Welding.

**Answer:**
-   **Welding**: Base metal melts. High strength. High temp ($>1000^\circ C$).
-   **Brazing**: Base metal does not melt. Filler melts ($>450^\circ C$). Medium strength.
-   **Soldering**: Base metal does not melt. Filler (solder) melts ($<450^\circ C$). Low strength (Electronics).

### 3. Gas Welding Flames
**Question:** Explain the three types of Oxy-acetylene flames and their applications.

**Answer:**
1.  **Neutral Flame** ($O_2:C_2H_2 = 1:1$): Balanced. For Mild steel, Stainless steel.
2.  **Oxidizing Flame** (Excess $O_2$): Hottest. For Copper, Zinc, Brass (to prevent Zn evaporation).
3.  **Reducing (Carburizing)** (Excess Acetylene): Cooler. For High carbon steel, Nickel (adds carbon).

### 4. Advanced Welding (TIG/MIG)
**Question:** Explain the principle and working of TIG and MIG welding processes.

**Answer:**
-   **TIG (GTAW)**: Uses **Non-consumable Tungsten electrode**. Inert gas (Argon) shields weld pool. Filler rod added separately. High quality welds (Al, Mg).
-   **MIG (GMAW)**: Uses **Consumable wire electrode** fed continuously from a spool. Inert gas shields arc. Faster, for thick plates.

### 3. Metal Forming

### 1. Forging vs Rolling
**Question:** Differentiate between Forging and Rolling processes.

**Answer:**
-   **Forging**: Shaping metal by compressive forces (hammering/pressing). Discrete parts (Connecting rods, gears). Stronger grain structure.
-   **Rolling**: Passing metal between rotating rolls to reduce thickness/change shape. Continuous products (Sheets, Rails).

### 2. Hot vs Cold Working
**Question:** Distinguish between Hot Working and Cold Working processes.

**Answer:**
-   **Hot Working**: Performed **above** recrystallization temperature. Low force required. No strain hardening. Poor surface finish (oxidation).
-   **Cold Working**: Performed **below** recrystallization temperature. High force required. Strain hardening occurs (strength increases). Good surface finish.
