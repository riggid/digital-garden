## Applied Mechanics & Materials

### Question 1
Which class of materials is characterized by a "sea" of delocalized electrons, resulting in high thermal and electrical conductivity?
*   A) Ceramics
*   B) Polymers
*   C) Metals
*   D) Composites

<details>
<summary><strong>Check Answer</strong></summary>

> **Correct Answer: C) Metals**
> The metallic bond involves delocalized electrons, facilitating conductivity and malleability.
</details>

### Question 2
In the stress-strain diagram for mild steel, the point where plastic deformation begins with little or no increase in load is called:
*   A) Proportional Limit
*   B) Ultimate Point
*   C) Fracture Point
*   D) Yield Point

<details>
<summary><strong>Check Answer</strong></summary>

> **Correct Answer: D) Yield Point**
> At yielding, the material deforms plastically at constant stress.
</details>

### Question 3
Poisson's Ratio ($\nu$) is defined as the ratio of:
*   A) Lateral Strain to Axial Strain (with a negative sign)
*   B) Axial Strain to Lateral Strain
*   C) Shear Stress to Shear Strain
*   D) Tensile Stress to Tensile Strain

<details>
<summary><strong>Check Answer</strong></summary>

> **Correct Answer: A) Lateral Strain to Axial Strain (with a negative sign)**
> $\nu = - \epsilon_{lateral} / \epsilon_{axial}$.
</details>

## Mechanical Properties

### Question 4
The ability of a material to absorb energy and plastically deform before fracturing is known as:
*   A) Hardness
*   B) Toughness
*   C) Stiffness
*   D) Elasticity

<details>
<summary><strong>Check Answer</strong></summary>

> **Correct Answer: B) Toughness**
> Toughness represents resistance to crack propagation and total energy absorption (area under the stress-strain curve).
</details>

### Question 5
Factor of Safety (F.S.) is calculated as:
*   A) Allowable Stress / Failure Stress
*   B) Failure Stress / Allowable Stress
*   C) Working Load / Ultimiate Load
*   D) Yield Stress * Allowable Stress

<details>
<summary><strong>Check Answer</strong></summary>

> **Correct Answer: B) Failure Stress / Allowable Stress**
> It provides a margin for uncertainty; F.S. must be > 1.
</details>

### Question 6
Hooke's Law states that within the elastic limit:
*   A) Stress is inversely proportional to Strain
*   B) Stress is proportional to Strain squared
*   C) Stress is directly proportional to Strain
*   D) Strain is constant

<details>
<summary><strong>Check Answer</strong></summary>

> **Correct Answer: C) Stress is directly proportional to Strain**
> $\sigma = E \epsilon$.
</details>

## Power Transmission

### Question 7
Which type of gear has teeth cut parallel to the axis of the shaft?
*   A) Helical Gear
*   B) Bevel Gear
*   C) Spur Gear
*   D) Worm Gear

<details>
<summary><strong>Check Answer</strong></summary>

> **Correct Answer: C) Spur Gear**
> Spur gears are the simplest type with straight, parallel teeth.
</details>

### Question 8
In a belt drive, "Slip" refers to:
*   A) The relative motion between the belt and pulley surface
*   B) The tightness of the belt
*   C) The angle of contact
*   D) The thickness of the belt

<details>
<summary><strong>Check Answer</strong></summary>

> **Correct Answer: A) The relative motion between the belt and pulley surface**
> Slip causes a reduction in the velocity ratio.
</details>

### Question 9
Double Helical gears are also known as:
*   A) Mitre Gears
*   B) Herringbone Gears
*   C) Rack and Pinion
*   D) Spiral Gears

<details>
<summary><strong>Check Answer</strong></summary>

> **Correct Answer: B) Herringbone Gears**
> They cancel out axial thrust.
</details>

### Question 10
For a simple gear train, the Velocity Ratio is:
*   A) $N_1 / N_2 = T_1 / T_2$
*   B) $N_1 / N_2 = T_2 / T_1$
*   C) $N_1 \times N_2 = T_1 \times T_2$
*   D) $N_1 + N_2 = T_1 + T_2$

<details>
<summary><strong>Check Answer</strong></summary>

> **Correct Answer: B) $N_1 / N_2 = T_2 / T_1$**
> Speed is inversely proportional to the number of teeth.
