## 📝 Selected Previous Year Questions with Solutions

### 1. Engineering Materials

### 1. Stress-Strain Diagram
**Question:** Draw the Stress-Strain diagram for a mild steel specimen subjected to a tensile test. Mark and explain all salient points.

**Answer:**
-   **Points**:
    1.  **Limit of Proportionality (A)**: Stress is proportional to Strain (Hooke's Law obeys).
    2.  **Elastic Limit (B)**: Material returns to original shape if unloaded.
    3.  **Upper/Lower Yield Points (C, D)**: Plastic deformation starts; stress drops slightly.
    4.  **Ultimate Tensile Strength (E)**: Maximum stress the material can withstand.
    5.  **Fracture Point (F)**: Specimen breaks.

### 2. Alloys
**Question:** What are alloys? Differentiate between Ferrous and Non-Ferrous alloys with examples.

**Answer:**
-   **Alloy**: A mixture of a metal with other elements to improve properties.
-   **Ferrous**: Iron is the main constituent (e.g., Steel, Cast Iron). Magnetic, prone to rust.
-   **Non-Ferrous**: Contain no iron (e.g., Aluminum, Copper, Brass). Corrosion resistant, non-magnetic, lighter.

### 3. Composites
**Question:** Define Composite materials. Explain the role of Matrix and Reinforcement phases. Classify composites based on matrix material.

**Answer:**
-   **Composite**: Material made of two or more distinct phases with significantly different properties.
-   **Phases**:
    -   **Matrix**: Continuous phase; binds reinforcement, transfers load, protects surface.
    -   **Reinforcement**: Discontinuous phase; provides strength and stiffness.
-   **Classification**:
    1.  **PMC**: Polymer Matrix Composite (e.g., Carbon Fiber/Epoxy).
    2.  **MMC**: Metal Matrix Composite (e.g., Al-SiC).
    3.  **CMC**: Ceramic Matrix Composite (e.g., C/SiC).

### 4. Smart Materials
**Question:** What are Smart Materials? Briefly explain Piezoelectric materials and Shape Memory Alloys (SMA).

**Answer:**
-   **Smart Materials**: Materials that sense and react to environmental changes (Temp, Stress, Field).
-   **Piezoelectric**: Generate voltage when mechanically stressed (Sensors, Lighters).
-   **SMA**: Remember original shape and return to it upon heating (Nitinol stent, actuators).

### 2. Mechanics of Materials

### 1. Elastic Constants & Relationship
**Question:** Define Young's Modulus (E), Shear Modulus (G), Bulk Modulus (K), and Poisson's ratio ($\nu$). State the relationship between E, G, and K.

**Answer:**
-   **E**: Ratio of longitudinal stress to strain (Stiffness).
-   **G**: Ratio of shear stress to shear strain (Rigidity).
-   **K**: Ratio of volumetric stress to volumetric strain.
-   **$\nu$**: Ratio of lateral strain to longitudinal strain.
-   **Relations**:
    $$ E = 2G(1 + \nu) $$
    $$ E = 3K(1 - 2\nu) $$

### 2. Hooke's Law & Factor of Safety
**Question:** State Hooke's Law. Define Factor of Safety.

**Answer:**
-   **Hooke's Law**: Within the elastic limit, stress is directly proportional to strain ($\sigma \propto \epsilon \implies \sigma = E \epsilon$).
-   **Factor of Safety (FOS)**:
    -   Ratio of Ultimate Stress (or Yield Stress) to Working (Design) Stress.
    -   $FOS = \frac{\text{Ultimate Stress}}{\text{Working Stress}}$.
    -   **Importance**: Accounts for uncertainty in loads, material defects, and ensures safety against failure.
