## 📝 Selected Previous Year Questions

### 1. Engineering Materials
1. **Stress-Strain Diagram**: Draw the Stress-Strain diagram for a mild steel specimen subjected to a tensile test. Mark and explain all salient points (Limit of Proportionality, Yield Point, UTS, Fracture).
2. **Alloys**: What are alloys? Differentiate between Ferrous and Non-Ferrous alloys with examples.
3. **Composites**: Define Composite materials. Explain the role of Matrix and Reinforcement phases. Classify composites based on matrix material (PMC, MMC, CMC).
4. **Smart Materials**: What are Smart Materials? Briefly explain Piezoelectric materials and Shape Memory Alloys (SMA) with applications.

### 2. Mechanics of Materials
1. **Elastic Constants**: Define Young's Modulus (E), Shear Modulus (G), Bulk Modulus (K), and Poisson's ratio ($\nu$). State the relationship between E, G, and K.
2. **Hooke's Law**: State Hooke's Law. Explain the terms Stress and Strain.
3. **Factor of Safety**: Define Factor of Safety. Why is it important in engineering design?
