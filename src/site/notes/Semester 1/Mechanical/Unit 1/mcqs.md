## Introduction to Thermodynamics & Systems

### Question 1
What is the term for a system that can exchange both energy and matter with its surroundings?
*   A) Closed System
*   B) Open System
*   C) Isolated System
*   D) Adiabatic System

<details>
<summary><strong>Check Answer</strong></summary>

> **Correct Answer: B) Open System**
> An open system allows transfer of both mass/matter and energy across its boundary (e.g., a boiling pot without a lid).
</details>

### Question 2
Which of the following is an **Intensive Property**?
*   A) Volume
*   B) Mass
*   C) Temperature
*   D) Total Energy

<details>
<summary><strong>Check Answer</strong></summary>

> **Correct Answer: C) Temperature**
> Intensive properties are independent of the system's size or mass. Pressure and Temperature are examples.
</details>

### Question 3
The Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics provides the basis for the measurement of:
*   A) Energy
*   B) Work
*   C) Temperature
*   D) Entropy

<details>
<summary><strong>Check Answer</strong></summary>

> **Correct Answer: C) Temperature**
> The Zeroth Law states that if two bodies are in thermal equilibrium with a third, they are in equilibrium with each other, defining temperature equality.
</details>

## Laws of Thermodynamics

### Question 4
The First Law of Thermodynamics is a statement of:
*   A) Conservation of Mass
*   B) Conservation of Energy
*   C) Conservation of Momentum
*   D) Increase of Entropy

<details>
<summary><strong>Check Answer</strong></summary>

> **Correct Answer: B) Conservation of Energy**
> $\Delta U = Q - W$. Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred.
</details>

### Question 5
Which statement of the Second Law implies that a refrigerator requires external work to operate?
*   A) Kelvin-Planck Statement
*   B) Clausius Statement
*   C) Joule's Statement
*   D) Avogadro's Statement

<details>
<summary><strong>Check Answer</strong></summary>

> **Correct Answer: B) Clausius Statement**
> It states heat cannot spontaneously flow from a cold body to a hot body without external work input.
</details>

## IC Engines & Cycles

### Question 6
Reflecting on the compression ratio ($r$), it is defined as the ratio of:
*   A) Swept Volume to Clearance Volume
*   B) Indicated Power to Brake Power
*   C) Total Cylinder Volume (at BDC) to Clearance Volume (at TDC)
*   D) BDC Volume to TDC Volume

<details>
<summary><strong>Check Answer</strong></summary>

> **Correct Answer: C) Total Cylinder Volume (at BDC) to Clearance Volume (at TDC)**
> $r = (V_s + V_c) / V_c$.
</details>

### Question 7
In a Compression Ignition (CI) engine, ignition is initiated by:
*   A) A spark plug
*   B) A glow plug
*   C) Self-ignition due to high temperature of compressed air
*   D) An external flame

<details>
<summary><strong>Check Answer</strong></summary>

> **Correct Answer: C) Self-ignition due to high temperature of compressed air**
> Diesel engines compress only air to high pressures/temperatures, causing injected fuel to auto-ignite.
</details>

### Question 8
The volume displaced by the piston in one stroke moving from TDC to BDC is called:
*   A) Clearance Volume
*   B) Swept Volume
*   C) Compression Volume
*   D) Total Volume

<details>
<summary><strong>Check Answer</strong></summary>

> **Correct Answer: B) Swept Volume**
> $V_s = A \times L$.
</details>

## Efficiency & Vehicles

### Question 9
Mechanical Efficiency ($\eta_{mech}$) of an engine is the ratio of:
*   A) Brake Power to Indicated Power
*   B) Indicated Power to Brake Power
*   C) Heat Supplied to Brake Power
*   D) Friction Power to Indicated Power

<details>
<summary><strong>Check Answer</strong></summary>

> **Correct Answer: A) Brake Power to Indicated Power**
> $\eta_{mech} = BP / IP$. It indicates how much generated power reaches the crankshaft.
</details>

### Question 10
Which type of electric vehicle has both an internal combustion engine and an electric motor but cannot be plugged into the grid?
*   A) BEV (Battery Electric Vehicle)
*   B) PHEV (Plug-in Hybrid)
*   C) HEV (Hybrid Electric Vehicle)
*   D) FCEV (Fuel Cell Vehicle)

<details>
<summary><strong>Check Answer</strong></summary>

> **Correct Answer: C) HEV (Hybrid Electric Vehicle)**
> HEVs charge their battery via the engine and regenerative braking, not an external plug.
</details>
