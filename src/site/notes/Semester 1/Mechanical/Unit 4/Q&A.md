## 1. Metal Cutting Fundamentals: Machining Operations and Chip Formation

**1. Define "machining" or "metal cutting" and state the three major functions of a machine tool.**
*   **Answer**: Machining is material removal by shearing/cutting. Machine tool functions: rigid support of workpiece/tool, provide relative motion, provide speeds/feeds. See [Core Notes.md](Core%20Notes.md#111-functions-of-a-machine-tool).

**2. Identify the three main categories of chips formed during metal cutting.**
*   **Answer**: Continuous chip, Discontinuous chip, Continuous chip with built-up edge. See [Core Notes.md](Core%20Notes.md#123-categories-of-chips-formed-during-metal-cutting).

**3. Explain "secondary shear" in metal cutting and its cause.**
*   **Answer**: Occurs when newly formed chips compress and shear off previously welded chip material from the tool's rake surface, due to friction-induced welding. See [Core Notes.md](Core%20Notes.md#121-primary-and-secondary-shear-zones).

**4. Explain the primary difference between Conventional Machining and Non-Conventional Machining processes, including their primary energy sources and give examples of each.**
*   **Answer**: **Conventional**: Physical tool contact, chip removal, mechanical energy (e.g., Turning, Milling). **Non-Conventional**: Often no direct contact, material removed via thermal/chemical/electrical/abrasive energy, no traditional chips (e.g., AJM, EBM). See [Core Notes.md](Core%20Notes.md#13-conventional-vs-non-conventional-machining).

## 2. Lathe Operations: Turning, Taper Turning, and Work Holding

**5. Describe the function of the Headstock and Tailstock components on a Lathe machine.**
*   **Answer**: **Headstock**: Left end, contains spindle (speed control), distributes power. **Tailstock**: Right end, movable, supports workpiece, holds drills/reamers, used for taper turning offset. See [Core Notes.md](Core%20Notes.md#211-main-parts-of-a-lathe-machine).

**6. Explain "Plain Turning" and "Facing" operations performed on a Lathe machine, including their purpose and workpiece/tool motions.**
*   **Answer**: **Plain Turning**: Produce cylindrical surface, workpiece rotates, tool feeds parallel to axis. **Facing**: Produce flat end surfaces, workpiece rotates, tool feeds perpendicular to axis. See [Core Notes.md](Core%20Notes.md#22-lathe-operations-turning-facing-taper-turning-thread-cutting-knurling-parting).

**7. Describe at least four different methods of "Taper Turning" on a Lathe, explaining how each achieves the conical shape.**
*   **Answer**: Form Tools, Swiveling Compound Rest, Offsetting Tailstock, Taper Turning Attachment. Each uses different tool/workpiece setup or motion to generate conical surface. See [Core Notes.md](Core%20Notes.md#22-lathe-operations-turning-facing-taper-turning-thread-cutting-knurling-parting).

**8. For quickly centering and clamping a cylindrical part on a lathe, what type of chuck is most efficient and why?**
*   **Answer**: A **three-jaw (self-centering) chuck** is most efficient. All jaws move simultaneously, automatically centering round/symmetrical jobs. See [Core Notes.md](Core%20Notes.md#23-work-holding-devices-chucks) and [Examples.md](Examples.md#Example%202:%20Efficient%20Chuck%20for%20Cylindrical%20Part).

**9. Explain the calculation of machining time and determination of roughing/finishing passes for a single turning operation.**
*   **Answer**: Machining time $t = \frac{L + L_o}{f \times N}$. Number of passes derived from total stock, finish allowance, and depth of cut. See [Core Notes.md](Core%20Notes.md#24-machining-time-calculation-for-turning-operations).

**10. Describe the Drilling operation and the main parts and functions of a Twist Drill's spiral flutes.**
*   **Answer**: Drilling makes holes with a rotating drill bit. Twist drill has body and shank. Flutes remove chips, admit coolant, curl chips, and form cutting edges. See [Core Notes.md](Core%20Notes.md#252-twist-drill-tool-parts-and-flute-functions).

**11. Differentiate between "Up Milling (Conventional Milling)" and "Down Milling (Climb Milling)" in terms of cutter rotation vs. table movement and impact on cutting forces/stability.**
*   **Answer**: **Up Milling**: Cutter rotates opposite to feed; forces lift workpiece (needs rigid clamping). **Down Milling**: Cutter rotates same direction as feed; forces push workpiece down (improves stability). See [Core Notes.md](Core%20Notes.md#262-up-milling-conventional-milling-vs-down-milling-climb-milling).

**12. Compare the construction and operational capabilities of a "Horizontal Milling Machine" versus a "Vertical Milling Machine."**
*   **Answer**: Differentiated by spindle orientation (horizontal vs. vertical), cutter movement, mounting, tilt, and typical operations. See [Core Notes.md](Core%20Notes.md#263-horizontal-vs-vertical-milling-machines).

## 3. Non-Conventional Machining Processes (UCM): Advanced Material Removal

**13. What distinguishes Unconventional Machining Processes (UCM) from conventional machining? List its main characteristics and suitability.**
*   **Answer**: UCM uses non-mechanical energy (thermal, chemical, electrical) to remove material, often without direct tool contact, with no traditional chip formation. Suitable for hard materials, intricate shapes. See [Core Notes.md](Core%20Notes.md#312-distinction-from-conventional-machining-and-main-characteristics).

**14. Describe the principle of operation for Abrasive Jet Machining (AJM). Explain how material removal occurs and list its key advantages and limitations.**

Limitations: low MRR, not for ductile materials. See [Core Notes.md](Core%20Notes.md#32-abrasive-jet-machining-ajm) and [Examples.md](Examples.md#Example%203:%20Non-Conventional%20Machining%20for%20Ceramic%20Holes).

**15. Explain the principle of operation of Electron Beam Machining (EBM). Describe the mechanism of material removal and list at least three advantages and three disadvantages.**
*   **Answer**: Focused high-speed electron beam transfers kinetic energy to melt/vaporize material. Advantages: no burr/HAZ (controlled), fast for tough alloys, high precision. Disadvantages: high cost, vacuum needed, complex setup. See [Core Notes.md](Core%20Notes.md#33-electron-beam-machining-ebm).
