## Machining & Heat Treatment

### Question 1
In a Lathe, the operation of producing a cylindrical surface by moving the tool parallel to the axis of rotation is called:
*   A) Facing
*   B) Turning
*   C) Knurling
*   D) Grooving

<details>
<summary><strong>Check Answer</strong></summary>

> **Correct Answer: B) Turning**
> Turning reduces diameter to creating a cylinder.
</details>

### Question 2
In **Down Milling** (Climb Milling):
*   A) The cutter rotates against the direction of feed
*   B) The cutter rotates in the same direction as the feed
*   C) Surface finish is generally poorer than Up Milling
*   D) Chip thickness starts at zero

<details>
<summary><strong>Check Answer</strong></summary>

> **Correct Answer: B) The cutter rotates in the same direction as the feed**
> Forces hold the workpiece down; chip thickness starts at maximum.
</details>

### Question 3
The heat treatment process involving heating steel above its critical temperature and cooling it **slowly in the furnace** is:
*   A) Normalizing
*   B) Quenching
*   C) Annealing
*   D) Tempering

<details>
<summary><strong>Check Answer</strong></summary>

> **Correct Answer: C) Annealing**
> Furnace cooling produces a soft, ductile structure (coarse pearlite).
</details>

### Question 4
Which Advanced Machining Process requires a **high vacuum**?
*   A) Abrasive Jet Machining (AJM)
*   B) Electron Beam Machining (EBM)
*   C) Laser Beam Machining (LBM)
*   D) Ultrasonic Machining (USM)

<details>
<summary><strong>Check Answer</strong></summary>

> **Correct Answer: B) Electron Beam Machining (EBM)**
> Vacuum is needed to prevent electron scattering and filament oxidation.
</details>

## Robotics & Control Systems

### Question 5
A **SCARA** robot is characterized by:
*   A) High vertical stiffness and horizontal compliance
*   B) Spherical work envelope
*   C) Three linear joints
*   D) Low vertical stiffness

<details>
<summary><strong>Check Answer</strong></summary>

> **Correct Answer: A) High vertical stiffness and horizontal compliance**
> "Selective Compliance Assembly Robot Arm" - ideal for insertion tasks.
</details>

### Question 6
Which robot configuration has a **Spherical** work envelope?
*   A) Cartesian
*   B) Cylindrical
*   C) Polar
*   D) SCARA

<details>
<summary><strong>Check Answer</strong></summary>

> **Correct Answer: C) Polar**
> Uses T-R-L joints (Twisting base, Rotational shoulder, Linear arm).
</details>

### Question 7
The key difference between an **Open Loop** and a **Closed Loop** control system is:
*   A) The presence of a controller
*   B) The presence of feedback
*   C) The type of actuator
*   D) The energy source

<details>
<summary><strong>Check Answer</strong></summary>

> **Correct Answer: B) The presence of feedback**
> Closed loop systems use feedback to correct errors; open loop do not.
</details>

### Question 8
In Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) 3D printing, the raw material is typically defined as:
*   A) Liquid resin
*   B) Metal powder
*   C) Thermoplastic filament
*   D) Ceramic slurry

<details>
<summary><strong>Check Answer</strong></summary>

> **Correct Answer: C) Thermoplastic filament**
> Filament is melted and extruded layer by layer.
</details>

### Question 9
In CNC programming, **G-codes** are primarily used for:
*   A) Miscellaneous functions (Coolant on/off)
*   B) Preparatory functions (Tool motion control)
*   C) Spindle speed control
*   D) Tool changing

<details>
<summary><strong>Check Answer</strong></summary>

> **Correct Answer: B) Preparatory functions (Tool motion control)**
> G-codes control geometry and movement (e.g., G01 Linear, G02 Circular).
</details>

### Question 10
Which of the following is NOT a benefit of CNC over conventional NC?
*   A) Program storage (Memory)
*   B) On-site editing
*   C) Elimination of tape reader reliance for every cycle
*   D) Lower initial cost

<details>
<summary><strong>Check Answer</strong></summary>

> **Correct Answer: D) Lower initial cost**
> CNC machines are significantly more expensive than manual or simple NC machines.
</details>
