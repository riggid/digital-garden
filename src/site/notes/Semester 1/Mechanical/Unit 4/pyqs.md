## 📝 Selected Previous Year Questions with Solutions

### 1. Machining and Machine Tools

### 1. Lathe Operations
**Question:** Explain the construction and working of a Lathe machine. List and briefly explain any four operations performed on it.

**Answer:**
-   **Construction**: Bed, Headstock (Engine), Tailstock (Support), Carriage (Tool post).
-   **Working**: Workpiece rotates in chuck; Tool moves linearly against it to remove material.
-   **Operations**:
    1.  **Turning**: Reducing diameter of cylindrical workpiece.
    2.  **Facing**: Cutting flat surface at the end (reducing length).
    3.  **Taper Turning**: Creating a conical shape.
    4.  **Knurling**: Creating rough pattern for grip.

### 2. Milling (Up vs Down)
**Question:** Differentiate between Up Milling and Down Milling processes.

**Answer:**
-   **Up Milling (Conventional)**: Cutter rotates **against** direction of feed. Chip thickness starts at 0 and increases. Tool tends to lift work. Safer for rough surfaces.
-   **Down Milling (Climb)**: Cutter rotates **with** direction of feed. Chip thickness starts max and decreases. Pulls work into cutter. Better finish, needs rigid setup.

### 3. Non-Conventional Machining (AJM)
**Question:** Explain the working principle of Abrasive Jet Machining (AJM). List advantages and applications.

**Answer:**
-   **Principle**: High velocity stream of gas (air/N2) mixed with abrasive particles impacts the workpiece. Erosion removes material.
-   **Advantages**: Cuts hard/brittle materials (Glass, Ceramics). No heat generated. Intricate shapes.
-   **Applications**: Drilling glass, cutting germanium, cleaning surfaces.

### 4. Electron Beam Machining (EBM)
**Question:** Explain the principle and working of Electron Beam Machining (EBM).

**Answer:**
-   **Principle**: High velocity electrons focused into a beam impact the workpiece. Kinetic energy converts to Thermal energy, vaporizing material instantly. Vacuum is required.
-   **Advantages**: extremely precise (micro-drilling), high aspect ratio holes.
-   **Limitations**: High vacuum needed, high equipment cost.

### 2. Heat Treatment and Control Systems

### 1. Annealing vs Normalizing
**Question:** Explain Annealing and Normalizing processes.

**Answer:**
-   **Annealing**: Heating and cooling **slowly in furnace**. *Purpose*: Soften material, relieve stress, improve ductility.
-   **Normalizing**: Heating and cooling **in still air**. *Purpose*: Refine grain structure, improve strength/hardness slightly more than annealing.

### 2. Hardening and Tempering
**Question:** Explain Hardening (Quenching) and Tempering. Why is tempering performed after hardening?

**Answer:**
-   **Hardening**: Heating and cooling **rapidly (Quenching)** in water/oil. Forms Martensite (very hard, brittle).
-   **Tempering**: Reheating hardened steel to below critical temp and cooling.
-   **Reason**: Hardening makes steel too brittle. Tempering restores **toughness** and ductility while sacrificing some hardness.

### 3. Control Systems
**Question:** Differentiate between Open Loop and Closed Loop control systems with examples.

**Answer:**
-   **Open Loop**: No feedback. Output does not affect input. Simple, cheap, inaccurate. *Example*: Bread Toaster (Timer based, doesn't check darkness).
-   **Closed Loop**: Feedback exists. Sensor compares output with desired reference and corrects error. Complex, accurate. *Example*: AC with thermostat (Maintains set temp).

### 4. NC and CNC
**Question:** Briefly explain the difference between NC and CNC machines.

**Answer:**
-   **NC (Numerical Control)**: Controlled by punched tapes/cards. Hard-wired logic. Difficult to modify program.
-   **CNC (Computer Numerical Control)**: Controlled by a dedicated computer/processor. Soft-wired. Easy to edit/store programs (G-code). Higher flexibility.
