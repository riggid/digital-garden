## 1. Metal Cutting Fundamentals: Machining Operations and Chip Formation

**1. Define "machining" or "metal cutting" and state the three major functions of a machine tool.**
*   **Answer**: Machining is material removal by shearing/cutting. Machine tool functions: rigid support of workpiece/tool, provide relative motion, provide speeds/feeds. See [[Semester 1/Mechanical/Unit 4/Core Notes#111-functions-of-a-machine-tool\|Core Notes.md]].

**2. Identify the three main categories of chips formed during metal cutting.**
*   **Answer**: Continuous chip, Discontinuous chip, Continuous chip with built-up edge. See [[Semester 1/Mechanical/Unit 4/Core Notes#123-categories-of-chips-formed-during-metal-cutting\|Core Notes.md]].

**3. Explain "secondary shear" in metal cutting and its cause.**
*   **Answer**: Occurs when newly formed chips compress and shear off previously welded chip material from the tool's rake surface, due to friction-induced welding. See [[Semester 1/Mechanical/Unit 4/Core Notes#121-primary-and-secondary-shear-zones\|Core Notes.md]].

**4. Explain the primary difference between Conventional Machining and Non-Conventional Machining processes, including their primary energy sources and give examples of each.**
*   **Answer**: **Conventional**: Physical tool contact, chip removal, mechanical energy (e.g., Turning, Milling). **Non-Conventional**: Often no direct contact, material removed via thermal/chemical/electrical/abrasive energy, no traditional chips (e.g., AJM, EBM). See [[Semester 1/Mechanical/Unit 4/Core Notes#13-conventional-vs-non-conventional-machining\|Core Notes.md]].

## 2. Lathe Operations: Turning, Taper Turning, and Work Holding

**5. Describe the function of the Headstock and Tailstock components on a Lathe machine.**
*   **Answer**: **Headstock**: Left end, contains spindle (speed control), distributes power. **Tailstock**: Right end, movable, supports workpiece, holds drills/reamers, used for taper turning offset. See [[Semester 1/Mechanical/Unit 4/Core Notes#211-main-parts-of-a-lathe-machine\|Core Notes.md]].

**6. Explain "Plain Turning" and "Facing" operations performed on a Lathe machine, including their purpose and workpiece/tool motions.**
*   **Answer**: **Plain Turning**: Produce cylindrical surface, workpiece rotates, tool feeds parallel to axis. **Facing**: Produce flat end surfaces, workpiece rotates, tool feeds perpendicular to axis. See [[Semester 1/Mechanical/Unit 4/Core Notes#22-lathe-operations-turning-facing-taper-turning-thread-cutting-knurling-parting\|Core Notes.md]].

**7. Describe at least four different methods of "Taper Turning" on a Lathe, explaining how each achieves the conical shape.**
*   **Answer**: Form Tools, Swiveling Compound Rest, Offsetting Tailstock, Taper Turning Attachment. Each uses different tool/workpiece setup or motion to generate conical surface. See [[Semester 1/Mechanical/Unit 4/Core Notes#22-lathe-operations-turning-facing-taper-turning-thread-cutting-knurling-parting\|Core Notes.md]].

**8. For quickly centering and clamping a cylindrical part on a lathe, what type of chuck is most efficient and why?**
*   **Answer**: A **three-jaw (self-centering) chuck** is most efficient. All jaws move simultaneously, automatically centering round/symmetrical jobs. See [[Semester 1/Mechanical/Unit 4/Core Notes#23-work-holding-devices-chucks\|Core Notes.md]] and [[Semester 1/Mechanical/Unit 4/Examples#example-2:-efficient-chuck-for-cylindrical-part\|Examples.md]].

**9. Explain the calculation of machining time and determination of roughing/finishing passes for a single turning operation.**
*   **Answer**: Machining time $t = \frac{L + L_o}{f \times N}$. Number of passes derived from total stock, finish allowance, and depth of cut. See [[Semester 1/Mechanical/Unit 4/Core Notes#24-machining-time-calculation-for-turning-operations\|Core Notes.md]].

**10. Describe the Drilling operation and the main parts and functions of a Twist Drill's spiral flutes.**
*   **Answer**: Drilling makes holes with a rotating drill bit. Twist drill has body and shank. Flutes remove chips, admit coolant, curl chips, and form cutting edges. See [[Semester 1/Mechanical/Unit 4/Core Notes#252-twist-drill-tool-parts-and-flute-functions\|Core Notes.md]].

**11. Differentiate between "Up Milling (Conventional Milling)" and "Down Milling (Climb Milling)" in terms of cutter rotation vs. table movement and impact on cutting forces/stability.**
*   **Answer**: **Up Milling**: Cutter rotates opposite to feed; forces lift workpiece (needs rigid clamping). **Down Milling**: Cutter rotates same direction as feed; forces push workpiece down (improves stability). See [[Semester 1/Mechanical/Unit 4/Core Notes#262-up-milling-conventional-milling-vs-down-milling-climb-milling\|Core Notes.md]].

**12. Compare the construction and operational capabilities of a "Horizontal Milling Machine" versus a "Vertical Milling Machine."**
*   **Answer**: Differentiated by spindle orientation (horizontal vs. vertical), cutter movement, mounting, tilt, and typical operations. See [[Semester 1/Mechanical/Unit 4/Core Notes#263-horizontal-vs-vertical-milling-machines\|Core Notes.md]].

## 3. Non-Conventional Machining Processes (UCM): Advanced Material Removal

**13. What distinguishes Unconventional Machining Processes (UCM) from conventional machining? List its main characteristics and suitability.**

Limitations: low MRR, not for ductile materials. See [[Semester 1/Mechanical/Unit 4/Core Notes#32-abrasive-jet-machining-ajm\|Core Notes.md]] and [[Semester 1/Mechanical/Unit 4/Examples#example-3:-non-conventional-machining-for-ceramic-holes\|Examples.md]].

**15. Explain the principle of operation of Electron Beam Machining (EBM). Describe the mechanism of material removal and list at least three advantages and three disadvantages.**

See [[Semester 1/Mechanical/Unit 4/Core Notes#42-annealing-process\|Core Notes.md]].

**19. Describe the "Tempering" heat treatment process. Explain its definition, primary purposes, and differentiate between its three main temperature-based types.**

Types: Low (150-250°C), Medium (350-450°C), High (500-600°C), each yielding different hardness/toughness balance. See [[Semester 1/Mechanical/Unit 4/Core Notes#44-tempering-process\|Core Notes.md]].

**20. Explain "Carburizing" as a case hardening process. Describe its effect and intended microstructure.**
*   **Answer**: Heating low-carbon steel in carbon-rich atmosphere to absorb carbon into surface (case). After quenching, case becomes hard martensite, core remains tough. See [[Semester 1/Mechanical/Unit 4/Core Notes#452-carburizing\|Core Notes.md]].

**23. Evaluate the effectiveness of "Induction Hardening" for large steel components. Discuss its advantages (distortion, core properties) and limitations.**
*   **Answer**: Effective surface hardening via rapid, localized induction heating. Advantages: low distortion, maintained core toughness, localized hardness. Limitations: high cost, precise control, material specific. See [[Semester 1/Mechanical/Unit 4/Core Notes#46-induction-hardening\|Core Notes.md]].
