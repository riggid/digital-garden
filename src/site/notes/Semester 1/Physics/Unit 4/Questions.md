# Unit 7: Lasers, Optoelectronics, and Advanced Materials - Q&A

This section provides concise answers or references to detailed explanations for conceptual questions related to the unit.

## 1. Interaction of Radiation with Matter - Einstein's Coefficients

### 1. Write the dimensions for each of the Einstein coefficients.

#### Answer
*   **$A_{21}$ (Spontaneous Emission)**: $[Time]^{-1}$ (e.g., s$^{-1}$)
*   **$B_{12}$ (Stimulated Absorption)**: $[Length][Time][Mass]^{-1}[Frequency]$ (e.g., $\text{m}^3 \text{ J}^{-1} \text{ s}^{-1}$)
*   **$B_{21}$ (Stimulated Emission)**: $[Length][Time][Mass]^{-1}[Frequency]$ (e.g., $\text{m}^3 \text{ J}^{-1} \text{ s}^{-1}$)

See [[Semester 1/Physics/Unit 4/Core Notes#11-stimulated-absorption\|Core Notes.md]] for detailed derivation of dimensions.

### 2. Show that the lifetime of a state undergoing spontaneous emission is the inverse of the A coefficient.

#### Answer
The rate of decay due to spontaneous emission is $\frac{dN_2}{dt} = -A_{21} N_2$. Integrating this gives $N_2(t) = N_2(0)e^{-A_{21}t}$. By definition, the lifetime $\tau$ is the time when $N_2(\tau) = N_2(0)/e$. Comparing exponents, $A_{21}\tau = 1$, so $\tau = 1/A_{21}$.

See [[Semester 1/Physics/Unit 4/Core Notes#12-spontaneous-emission\|Core Notes.md]] for detailed explanation.

### 3. With a neat diagram explain the process of stimulated absorption and emission.

#### Answer
See [[Semester 1/Physics/Unit 4/Core Notes#11-stimulated-absorption\|Core Notes.md]] and [[Semester 1/Physics/Unit 4/Core Notes#13-stimulated-emission\|Core Notes.md]] for detailed explanations and diagrams.

### 4. How is the energy density of electromagnetic radiation described in terms of Planck’s quantum theory?

#### Answer
Planck's quantum theory describes the spectral energy density of blackbody radiation $u(\nu)$ as $u(\nu) = \frac{8\pi h \nu^3}{c^3} \frac{1}{e^{h\nu/k_B T} - 1}$. This expression quantifies the energy distributed over different frequencies for a system in thermal equilibrium.

See [[Semester 1/Physics/Unit 4/Core Notes#14-einsteins-relations-and-energy-density\|Core Notes.md]] for context.

### 5. Expression for energy density of electromagnetic radiation in terms of Einstein's coefficients.

#### Answer
In thermal equilibrium, the spectral energy density $u(\nu)$ can be expressed as $u(\nu) = \frac{A_{21}}{B_{21}} \frac{1}{e^{h\nu/k_B T} - 1}$. This relation, derived by Einstein, links the macroscopic radiation field to microscopic atomic transition probabilities.

See [[Semester 1/Physics/Unit 4/Core Notes#14-einsteins-relations-and-energy-density\|Core Notes.md]] for derivation and details.

## 2. Conditions for Laser Action

### 6. Condition for laser action in two, three and four level systems.

#### Answer
The fundamental condition for laser action in all systems is **population inversion** ($N_2 > N_1$). The feasibility and efficiency of achieving and maintaining this state differ across systems:
*   **Two-level systems**: Cannot sustain population inversion under continuous pumping; hence, laser action is practically impossible.
*   **Three-level systems**: Achieve inversion by pumping from ground to a short-lived level, then non-radiative decay to a metastable upper laser level. The lower laser level is the ground state, requiring >50% of atoms to be excited, hence high pump power and often pulsed operation.
*   **Four-level systems**: Achieve inversion by pumping from ground to a short-lived level, then non-radiative decay to a metastable upper laser level. The lower laser level is an excited state with a very short lifetime, which rapidly empties to the ground state. This keeps $N_1 \approx 0$, making inversion easy to achieve with lower pump power and enabling CW operation.

See [[Semester 1/Physics/Unit 4/Core Notes#22-two-level-systems\|Core Notes.md]], [[Semester 1/Physics/Unit 4/Core Notes#23-three-level-systems\|Core Notes.md]], and [[Semester 1/Physics/Unit 4/Core Notes#24-four-level-systems\|Core Notes.md]] for detailed explanations.

### 7. Is a two-level laser impossible? Submit a review.

#### Answer
Yes, continuous-wave (CW) laser action in a strict two-level system is virtually impossible to sustain. This is because, due to $B_{12}=B_{21}$, continuous pumping rapidly leads to saturation ($N_1 \approx N_2$). At this point, stimulated absorption equals stimulated emission, resulting in no net gain. To achieve $N_2 > N_1$ would require a "negative temperature," which is not a continuously stable condition. Therefore, practical lasers require at least three or, more commonly, four energy levels to create and maintain population inversion out of equilibrium.

See [[Semester 1/Physics/Unit 4/Core Notes#22-two-level-systems\|Core Notes.md]] for a review.

### 8. Bring out the difference between three-level and four-level lasers.

#### Answer
See [[Semester 1/Physics/Unit 4/Core Notes#25-difference-between-three-level-and-four-level-lasers\|Core Notes.md]] for a detailed comparison table.

### 9. Draw the energy level diagram and explain how 4-level laser systems work.

#### Answer
See [[Semester 1/Physics/Unit 4/Core Notes#24-four-level-systems\|Core Notes.md]] for diagram and detailed explanation.

## 3. Basic Requirements of a Laser System

### 10. Requirements of a LASER – active medium, energy pump and resonant cavity.

#### Answer
A laser requires:
1.  **Active Medium**: A material (solid, gas, liquid, semiconductor) with suitable energy levels to achieve population inversion and optical gain.
2.  **Energy Pump Source**: An external energy supply (optical, electrical, chemical, current injection) to excite the active medium and create population inversion.
3.  **Resonant Cavity**: Typically two mirrors (one highly reflective, one partially transmissive) that provide feedback, confine light, allow for amplification through multiple passes, ensure directionality, and select specific wavelengths.

See [[Semester 1/Physics/Unit 4/Core Notes#3-basic-requirements-of-a-laser-system\|Core Notes.md]] for detailed explanations.

### 11. List the active media, energy pump for any four lasers.

#### Answer
1.  **Ruby Laser**: **Active Medium**: Chromium-doped Alumina ($Cr^{3+}$:$\text{Al}_2\text{O}_3$ crystal). **Energy Pump**: Xenon flash lamp (optical pumping).
2.  **He-Ne Laser**: **Active Medium**: Helium-Neon gas mixture (He:Ne, 10:1 ratio). **Energy Pump**: Electrical discharge (electrical pumping).
3.  **CO2 Laser**: **Active Medium**: Carbon Dioxide gas mixture ($\text{CO}_2$:$\text{N}_2$:He). **Energy Pump**: Electrical discharge (electrical pumping).
4.  **Diode Laser (Semiconductor Laser)**: **Active Medium**: Direct band gap semiconductor p-n junction (e.g., GaAs, GaInN). **Energy Pump**: Forward electric current injection (electrical pumping).

See [[Semester 1/Physics/Unit 4/Core Notes#6-types-of-lasers-atomic-gas-laser---he-ne-laser\|Core Notes.md]], [[Semester 1/Physics/Unit 4/Core Notes#7-molecular-gas-laser---co2-laser-vibrational-modes-of-co2-molecule\|Core Notes.md]], and [[Semester 1/Physics/Unit 4/Core Notes#83-semiconductor-laser-diode-laser\|Core Notes.md]] for details.

### 12. What is meant by active medium in a Laser? What is the role of metastable states in the operation of the laser?

#### Answer
The **active medium** (or gain medium) is the material where population inversion is created and stimulated emission occurs. **Metastable states** are crucial because they are excited energy levels with relatively long lifetimes, allowing atoms to accumulate in these states. This accumulation is essential for building up a sufficient population in the upper laser level ($N_2$) to exceed the population of the lower laser level ($N_1$), thereby achieving the necessary **population inversion** for laser action. Without metastable states, excited atoms would quickly decay spontaneously, preventing population inversion.

See [[Semester 1/Physics/Unit 4/Core Notes#31-active-medium-gain-medium\|Core Notes.md]] and [[Semester 1/Physics/Unit 4/Core Notes#23-three-level-systems\|Core Notes.md]] for more.

### 13. Mention the role of resonant cavity in laser device?

#### Answer
The **resonant cavity** (or optical resonator) provides optical feedback, confining light within the active medium for multiple passes, allowing for cumulative amplification through stimulated emission. It ensures the output beam is highly directional and monochromatic by supporting only specific resonant longitudinal modes that exceed the gain threshold. This sustained feedback is essential for continuous laser oscillation.

See [[Semester 1/Physics/Unit 4/Core Notes#33-resonant-cavity-optical-resonator\|Core Notes.md]] for more.

***

## 4. Round Trip Gain in a Laser Medium

### 14. Discuss round trip gain in a laser medium and hence obtain the expression for threshold gain.

#### Answer
The **round trip gain** is the net amplification experienced by light after making one complete round trip within the laser cavity, considering both gain from stimulated emission and various losses. For sustained laser oscillation, the intensity after one round trip must be equal to or greater than the starting intensity. The **threshold gain coefficient ($g_{th}$)** expression is $g_{th} = \alpha + \frac{1}{2L} \ln\left(\frac{1}{R_1 R_2}\right)$, where $\alpha$ is internal loss, $L$ is cavity length, and $R_1, R_2$ are mirror reflectivities.

See [[Semester 1/Physics/Unit 4/Core Notes#413-condition-for-round-trip-gain-threshold-condition\|Core Notes.md]] for detailed derivation.

### 15. Write a note on the losses in a laser cavity.

#### Answer
Losses in a laser cavity include:
1.  **Absorption**: Photons absorbed by the medium or cavity components.
2.  **Scattering**: Light scattered by imperfections in the medium or on mirror surfaces.
3.  **Diffraction Losses**: Light escaping the resonator due to wave spreading.
4.  **Mirror Transmission**: Intentional leakage of light through the output coupler.
5.  **Spontaneous Emission**: Incoherent photons lost from the desired laser mode.

These losses must be overcome by the gain from stimulated emission for laser action to occur.

See [[Semester 1/Physics/Unit 4/Core Notes#412-loss-processes-within-a-laser-cavity\|Core Notes.md]] for more details.

### 16. Discuss about cavity design considerations for a laser.

#### Answer
Cavity design considerations include:
1.  **Mirror Reflectivity**: Optimizing $R_1$ (high) and $R_2$ (output coupler) for maximum output power.
2.  **Cavity Length ($L$)**: Influences longitudinal mode spacing ($c/2L$) and stability.
3.  **Cavity Geometry**: Using concave mirrors to form stable resonators for good beam confinement and low diffraction losses (e.g., plano-concave, confocal).
4.  **Mode Control**: Designing for desired transverse (e.g., $\text{TEM}_{00}$) and longitudinal modes.
5.  **Material**: Choosing components transparent at the laser wavelength and damage-resistant.
6.  **Brewster's Windows**: For forcing polarized output and suppressing unwanted IR.

See [[Semester 1/Physics/Unit 4/Core Notes#42-cavity-design-considerations-for-a-laser\|Core Notes.md]] for a full discussion.

### 17. State the role of end mirrors in a laser cavity.

#### Answer
The end mirrors of a laser cavity (the optical resonator) primarily provide **optical feedback** to the active medium. One mirror is highly reflective, and the other is partially reflective (output coupler). They reflect photons repeatedly through the gain medium, allowing stimulated emission to amplify the light to a sufficient intensity. They also dictate the laser's directionality and help select specific resonant wavelengths (longitudinal modes), crucial for sustained, coherent laser operation.

See [[Semester 1/Physics/Unit 4/Core Notes#33-resonant-cavity-optical-resonator\|Core Notes.md]] for more.

***

## 5. Properties of LASERs

### 18. Properties of LASER – Coherence, monochromaticity (uncertainty principle, doppler effect), directionality.

#### Answer
Laser light is characterized by:
*   **Coherence**: High temporal (constant phase over time, long coherence length) and spatial (constant phase across wavefront, effectively point source) coherence.
*   **Monochromaticity**: Exceptionally narrow spectral linewidth due to specific atomic transitions and cavity mode filtering. Limitations arise from natural linewidth (uncertainty principle), Doppler broadening (thermal motion), and collision broadening.
*   **Directionality**: Very low divergence, forming a highly collimated beam due to the resonant cavity and high spatial coherence.

See [[Semester 1/Physics/Unit 4/Core Notes#51-monochromaticity-spectral-line-broadening\|Core Notes.md]], [[Semester 1/Physics/Unit 4/Core Notes#52-coherence\|Core Notes.md]], and [[Semester 1/Physics/Unit 4/Core Notes#53-directionality-low-divergence\|Core Notes.md]] for detailed explanations.

### 19. Explain why a laser is not a perfectly monochromatic source.

#### Answer
While highly monochromatic, lasers are not perfectly so because:
*   **Uncertainty Principle**: Atomic energy levels have finite lifetimes ($\Delta t$), leading to an intrinsic uncertainty in energy ($\Delta E$), which defines a natural linewidth ($\Delta\nu \approx 1/\Delta t$).
*   **Doppler Broadening**: In gas lasers, thermal motion of atoms causes variations in observed photon frequencies.
*   **Collision Broadening**: Collisions between atoms perturb energy levels.
*   **Multiple Longitudinal Modes**: The gain bandwidth of the active medium often encompasses several distinct resonant frequencies (longitudinal modes) of the cavity, leading to multiple very narrow spectral lines in the output.

See [[Semester 1/Physics/Unit 4/Core Notes#51-monochromaticity-spectral-line-broadening\|Core Notes.md]] for details.

### 20. Write a note on frequency comb and discuss about the gain curve.

#### Answer
The **gain curve** represents the range of frequencies over which the active medium can provide optical amplification. It's typically a broad, bell-shaped spectral profile. A **frequency comb** refers to the series of discrete, equally spaced resonant frequencies (longitudinal modes) supported by the optical cavity ($\Delta\nu_{FSR} = c/2L$). Only the longitudinal modes that fall within the gain curve and exceed the laser's threshold gain will oscillate and contribute to the laser output.

See [[Semester 1/Physics/Unit 4/Core Notes#55-frequency-comb-and-gain-curve\|Core Notes.md]] for more details.

### 21. Discuss any two properties of a laser that differentiate it from ordinary light sources.

#### Answer
1.  **High Coherence**: Laser light exhibits exceptional temporal and spatial coherence, meaning its waves maintain a constant phase relationship over long distances and across its wavefront. Ordinary light sources, being a collection of independent emitters, are highly incoherent.
2.  **High Monochromaticity**: Laser light consists of only a very narrow range of wavelengths (pure color). Ordinary light sources, even nominally "monochromatic" ones, emit light over a much broader spectrum.

See [[Semester 1/Physics/Unit 4/Core Notes#5-properties-of-lasers\|Core Notes.md]] for all laser properties.

## 6. Types of LASERs: Atomic Gas Laser - He-Ne Laser

### 22. Atomic Gas laser - He Ne Laser.

#### Answer
The He-Ne laser is a CW atomic gas laser operating at 632.8 nm (red light) as a four-level system. It uses a 10:1 mixture of He and Ne gases. Helium atoms are excited by electrical discharge and then transfer energy to Neon atoms via resonant collisions, populating Neon's upper laser levels. Rapid depopulation of Neon's lower laser levels ensures population inversion.

See [[Semester 1/Physics/Unit 4/Core Notes#61-he-ne-laser-system\|Core Notes.md]] for a complete explanation.

### 23. List the lifetimes of different states for the He-Ne system. What is the role of Helium gas?

#### Answer
*   **He Excited States ($2^1S, 2^3S$)**: Long lifetimes ($\approx 10^{-7}$ s).
*   **Ne Upper Laser Levels ($3s_2, 2s_2$)**: Relatively long lifetimes ($\approx 10^{-7}$ s).
*   **Ne Lower Laser Levels ($3p_4, 2p_4$)**: Very short lifetimes ($\approx 10^{-8}$ s).
*   **Ne Metastable State ($1s$)**: Long lifetimes ($\approx 10^{-7}$ s).

The **role of Helium gas** is critical: He atoms are primarily excited by the electrical discharge. They then efficiently transfer their energy to ground-state Neon atoms through **resonant collisions**, selectively populating the upper laser levels of Neon. This creates the necessary population inversion in Neon; without Helium, the Neon atoms would not be sufficiently excited for lasing.

See [[Semester 1/Physics/Unit 4/Core Notes#615-lifetimes-of-different-states-in-he-ne-system\|Core Notes.md]] and [[Semester 1/Physics/Unit 4/Core Notes#613-energy-levels-and-laser-action-four-level-system\|Core Notes.md]] for more details.

### 24. Why a narrow tube is used in He-Ne Laser? What happens if its diameter is increased?

#### Answer
A **narrow discharge tube** in a He-Ne laser is used to facilitate the rapid depopulation of the metastable $1s$ state of Neon (which is below the lower laser levels). Ne atoms in this $1s$ state collide frequently with the tube walls, undergoing non-radiative de-excitation to the ground state, thereby "clearing" this bottleneck level. If the **diameter is increased**, the probability of wall collisions decreases significantly. This leads to an accumulation of Ne atoms in the $1s$ state, which would then interfere with the population inversion mechanism by blocking the decay path from the lower laser levels, ultimately stopping or severely reducing laser action.

See [[Semester 1/Physics/Unit 4/Core Notes#613-energy-levels-and-laser-action-four-level-system\|Core Notes.md]] (Lower Level Depopulation) for context.

### 25. How can we eliminate unwanted IR radiation that accompanies with the visible radiation in He-Ne laser?

#### Answer
Unwanted IR radiation (e.g., 1152 nm, 3391 nm) in He-Ne lasers can be eliminated by:
1.  **Mirror Coatings**: Designing the dielectric coatings of the resonant cavity mirrors to have very high reflectivity at the desired visible wavelength (632.8 nm) and low reflectivity (high transmission) at the unwanted IR wavelengths.
2.  **Brewster's Windows**: Using Brewster's windows can induce polarization and help suppress some unwanted modes, though their primary role is polarization.
3.  **Additional Absorbing Gases**: Incorporating small quantities of gases (e.g., methane) that have strong absorption bands at the unwanted IR wavelengths, thus absorbing the IR photons and preventing them from oscillating.

See [[Semester 1/Physics/Unit 4/Core Notes#614-resonant-cavity\|Core Notes.md]] and [[Semester 1/Physics/Unit 4/Core Notes#42-cavity-design-considerations-for-a-laser\|Core Notes.md]] (Brewster's Windows) for related information.

## 7. Molecular Gas Laser - CO2 Laser: Vibrational Modes of CO2 Molecule

### 26. Molecular gas laser - CO2 laser: Vibrational modes of CO2 molecule.

#### Answer
The $\text{CO}_2$ laser is a powerful molecular gas laser (four-level system) operating in the IR. $\text{CO}_2$ molecules utilize three fundamental vibrational modes:
1.  **Symmetric Stretching Mode**: Both oxygen atoms move away from/towards the carbon atom simultaneously.
2.  **Bending Mode**: Atoms move perpendicular to the molecular axis, bending the molecule.
3.  **Asymmetric Stretching Mode**: Oxygen atoms move in opposite directions, while carbon also moves.

The asymmetric stretch (001) is the upper laser level, and the symmetric stretch (100) and bending mode (020) are the lower laser levels. Resonant energy transfer from excited $\text{N}_2$ molecules efficiently populates the (001) state, while rapid depopulation of lower levels (assisted by Helium) maintains inversion.

See [[Semester 1/Physics/Unit 4/Core Notes#713-vibrational-modes-of-co2-molecule\|Core Notes.md]] and [[Semester 1/Physics/Unit 4/Core Notes#714-energy-levels-and-laser-action-four-level-system\|Core Notes.md]] for detailed explanation and diagram.

### 27. What are the different modes of vibrations in a CO2 molecule?

#### Answer
The three fundamental vibrational modes of a linear $\text{CO}_2$ molecule are:
1.  **Symmetric stretching mode ($\nu_1$)**: Both O atoms move in phase relative to the central C.
2.  **Bending mode ($\nu_2$)**: Atoms move perpendicular to the molecular axis, causing the molecule to bend (degenerate).
3.  **Asymmetric stretching mode ($\nu_3$)**: O atoms move out of phase, and the C atom also moves.

These are quantized and correspond to the energy levels involved in $\text{CO}_2$ laser action.

See [[Semester 1/Physics/Unit 4/Core Notes#713-vibrational-modes-of-co2-molecule\|Core Notes.md]] for details.

### 28. With an energy level diagram discuss how lasing action is achieved in molecular laser.

#### Answer
See [[Semester 1/Physics/Unit 4/Core Notes#714-energy-levels-and-laser-action-four-level-system\|Core Notes.md]] for detailed discussion with an energy level diagram, focusing on $\text{CO}_2$ laser.

### 29. Mention the possible laser transitions that occur in CO2 laser?

#### Answer
The two primary laser transitions in a $\text{CO}_2$ laser occur from the (001) asymmetric stretching upper laser level:
1.  To the (100) symmetric stretching lower laser level, emitting at **10.6 µm**.
2.  To the (020) bending mode lower laser level, emitting at **9.6 µm**.

These are both in the infrared region of the spectrum.

See [[Semester 1/Physics/Unit 4/Core Notes#714-energy-levels-and-laser-action-four-level-system\|Core Notes.md]] for details.

## 8. Semiconductors and Light Emission

### 30. Write a note on the band structure of solids and the importance of E-k diagrams.

#### Answer
The **band structure** describes the allowed energy levels for electrons in a solid, forming valence and conduction bands separated by energy gaps. The **E-k diagram** (Energy vs. wave vector) visualizes this, critically showing the relationship between electron energy and crystal momentum. Its importance lies in distinguishing between **direct** and **indirect band gap semiconductors**. Direct band gap materials (where valence band maximum and conduction band minimum align in momentum space) allow for efficient radiative recombination (light emission), essential for LEDs and lasers. Indirect band gap materials require phonon assistance for recombination, leading to inefficient light emission (more heat than light).

See [[Semester 1/Physics/Unit 4/Core Notes#81-band-structure-of-solids-and-importance-of-e-k-diagrams\|Core Notes.md]] for a detailed note.

### 31. Concept of LED using direct band gap semiconductors, Semiconductor laser, energy band diagram.

#### Answer
*   **LED**: A Light-Emitting Diode uses a forward-biased **direct band gap semiconductor** p-n junction. Electrons are injected into the conduction band, and holes into the valence band, where they recombine radiatively to emit photons ($h\nu \approx E_g$).
*   **Semiconductor Laser**: A more refined LED structure where high current injection establishes **population inversion** (quasi-Fermi level splitting) in the active region of a direct band gap semiconductor. A resonant cavity formed by cleaved facets provides feedback for **stimulated emission**, leading to coherent laser light.
*   **Energy Band Diagram**: Illustrates the conduction and valence bands, energy gap ($E_g$), quasi-Fermi levels under bias, and electron-hole recombination leading to photon emission.

See [[Semester 1/Physics/Unit 4/Core Notes#82-concept-of-led-using-direct-band-gap-semiconductors\|Core Notes.md]] and [[Semester 1/Physics/Unit 4/Core Notes#83-semiconductor-laser-diode-laser\|Core Notes.md]] for detailed explanations, including diagrams.

### 32. Homo junction laser, draw backs.

#### Answer
A **homo-junction laser** is a semiconductor laser where the active region and cladding layers are made of the same semiconductor material. Its **drawbacks** include:
*   **Poor carrier confinement**: Injected electrons and holes easily diffuse away from the active region, reducing efficiency.
*   **Poor photon confinement**: Small refractive index difference means light easily escapes, leading to high optical losses.
*   **High threshold current density**: Requires very high current to achieve laser action, leading to excessive heat.
*   **Limited operation**: Often requires cryogenic temperatures or pulsed mode.

See [[Semester 1/Physics/Unit 4/Core Notes#841-homo-junction-laser\|Core Notes.md]] for more details.

### 33. Hetero junction laser: charge and photon confinement.

#### Answer
A **hetero-junction laser** (e.g., Double Heterostructure) uses layers of different direct band gap semiconductor materials.
*   **Charge Confinement**: Wider band gap cladding layers create potential barriers, trapping injected electrons and holes within the narrow band gap active region. This increases carrier concentration and enhances recombination efficiency.
*   **Photon Confinement**: The active layer has a higher refractive index than the cladding layers, forming an optical waveguide. This confines photons within the active region via total internal reflection, increasing interaction with carriers and reducing optical losses.

These confinements significantly reduce threshold current, improve efficiency, and enable room-temperature CW operation.

See [[Semester 1/Physics/Unit 4/Core Notes#842-hetero-junction-laser-charge-and-photon-confinement\|Core Notes.md]] for detailed explanations and a diagram.

### 34. What type of semiconducting material used in the fabrication of diode lasers and why such a material is chosen.

#### Answer
**Direct band gap semiconductors** (e.g., GaAs, InP, GaN, InGaN, AlGaAs) are used. These materials are chosen because the minimum of their conduction band and the maximum of their valence band align in momentum space (E-k diagram), allowing for **direct radiative recombination** of electrons and holes. This process efficiently converts electrical energy into photons, making them suitable for light emission, unlike indirect band gap semiconductors where recombination is primarily non-radiative (heat).

See [[Semester 1/Physics/Unit 4/Core Notes#812-importance-of-e-k-diagrams-direct-vs-indirect-band-gap\|Core Notes.md]] and [[Semester 1/Physics/Unit 4/Core Notes#83-semiconductor-laser-diode-laser\|Core Notes.md]] for details.

### 35. What is band gap engineering?

#### Answer
**Band gap engineering** is the deliberate design and control of the energy band gap and other electronic properties (like refractive index, effective masses) in semiconductor heterostructures by varying the composition and layering of different semiconductor materials. By precisely altering the material composition (e.g., in alloys like $\text{Al}_x\text{Ga}_{1-x}\text{As}$), the band gap can be tuned to emit light at desired wavelengths, optimize carrier and photon confinement, and enhance device performance. It is crucial for advanced optoelectronic devices like heterojunction lasers.

See [[Semester 1/Physics/Unit 4/Core Notes#842-hetero-junction-laser-charge-and-photon-confinement\|Core Notes.md]] for context.

### 36. Why creating white LEDs took a long time in the making?

#### Answer
Creating white LEDs was challenging because white light is a combination of multiple colors. It involved significant breakthroughs in:
1.  **Efficient Blue LEDs**: The development of high-efficiency **blue light-emitting semiconductor materials** (primarily Indium Gallium Nitride, InGaN) was a major technical hurdle, only achieved in the early 1990s.
2.  **Phosphor Technology**: For most commercial white LEDs, a blue LED excites a **yellow phosphor** coating. Developing stable, efficient, and tunable phosphors that can absorb blue light and re-emit yellow, while allowing some blue to pass through for white perception, was complex.

Without these two key advancements, white light generation from LEDs was not practical.

See [[Semester 1/Physics/Unit 4/Core Notes#843-why-creating-white-leds-took-a-long-time-in-the-making\|Core Notes.md]] for further explanation.

## 9. Holography

### 37. Briefly elaborate the off axis holographic recording method.

#### Answer
In **off-axis holography**, the reference beam is directed onto the holographic plate at a significant angle relative to the object beam. This angular separation of the two beams creates a high spatial frequency interference pattern on the recording medium. Upon reconstruction with a coherent reference beam, the original object's virtual image, a real image, and an undiffracted zero-order beam are produced at distinctly different spatial angles, allowing for a clear, separated 3D image viewing without overlap.

See [[Semester 1/Physics/Unit 4/Core Notes#92-off-axis-holographic-recording-method\|Core Notes.md]] for detailed explanation.

### 38. Holography: Offline holography – general interference expression and identification of the phase information terms.

#### Answer
In offline holography, an **object beam** ($E_O = A_O e^{i\phi_O}$) and a **reference beam** ($E_R = A_R e^{i\phi_R}$) interfere on a photographic plate to record an intensity pattern $I = |E_O|^2 + |E_R|^2 + E_O E_R^* + E_R E_O^*$. The crucial **interference terms** ($E_O E_R^*$ and $E_R E_O^*$) encode the **phase information ($\phi_O$)** of the object by converting phase differences ($\phi_O - \phi_R$) into intensity variations (fringes). When the hologram is illuminated during reconstruction, these terms recreate the original object wavefront (virtual image).

See [[Semester 1/Physics/Unit 4/Core Notes#91-offline-holography--general-interference-expression-and-identification-of-the-phase-information-terms\|Core Notes.md]] for detailed explanation and derivation.

### 39. What are the applications of Holography?

#### Answer
Holography applications include:
1.  **3D Imaging**: Holographic displays, art, and security features (banknotes, credit cards).
2.  **Interferometry**: Non-destructive testing (NDT), strain/vibration analysis in engineering.
3.  **Optical Elements**: Holographic gratings, lenses, and filters.
4.  **Data Storage**: Potential for high-density 3D data storage.
5.  **Microscopy**: 3D imaging of microscopic objects.

See [[Semester 1/Physics/Unit 4/Core Notes#93-applications-of-holography\|Core Notes.md]] for a comprehensive list.

### 40. Distinguish between holography and photography.

## 10. Dielectric Polarization

### 41. Polarization in dielectrics, P vs E relation.

#### Answer
**Polarization** in dielectrics is the formation of electric dipoles (induced or aligned permanent) per unit volume when an external electric field $\mathbf{E}$ is applied. The **polarization vector ($\mathbf{P}$)** quantifies this. For linear dielectrics, $\mathbf{P}$ is directly proportional to $\mathbf{E}$: $\mathbf{P} = \epsilon_0 \chi_e \mathbf{E}$, where $\chi_e$ is the electric susceptibility.

See [[Semester 1/Physics/Unit 4/Core Notes#101-polarization-in-dielectrics-p-vs-e-relation\|Core Notes.md]] for detailed explanation.

### 42. Explain how a microwave oven works.

#### Answer
A microwave oven heats food by exploiting **orientational polarization** in water molecules. A magnetron generates microwaves (e.g., 2.45 GHz), which create a rapidly oscillating electric field. Polar water molecules in food attempt to align with this field, causing them to rapidly rotate and reorient. This constant realignment generates frictional heat (dielectric heating) through intermolecular collisions, raising the food's temperature.

See [[Semester 1/Physics/Unit 4/Core Notes#104-microwave-oven-operation-how-it-works\|Core Notes.md]] for further details.

### 43. What is meant by dielectric polarization? List the various kinds of polarization mechanism that prevail in dielectric materials and how do those polarization mechanisms vary with temperature?

#### Answer
**Dielectric polarization** is the process by which an applied electric field induces or aligns electric dipoles within an insulating material, resulting in a net electric dipole moment per unit volume. The main mechanisms are:
1.  **Electronic Polarization**: Displacement of electron clouds relative to nuclei. Independent of temperature.
2.  **Ionic Polarization**: Displacement of positive and negative ions. Largely independent of temperature.
3.  **Orientational (Dipolar) Polarization**: Alignment of permanent molecular dipoles. Decreases with increasing temperature (due to thermal agitation).
4.  **Space Charge Polarization**: Accumulation of charges at interfaces/inhomogeneities. Strong temperature dependence (increases with temperature due to increased charge mobility).

See [[Semester 1/Physics/Unit 4/Core Notes#1011-polarization-mechanisms\|Core Notes.md]] for detailed explanations.

### 44. Internal fields in dielectrics.

#### Answer
The **internal field ($\mathbf{E}_{loc}$ or local field)** experienced by an individual atom or molecule within a dielectric is not simply the external applied field $\mathbf{E}_{ext}$. It's the sum of $\mathbf{E}_{ext}$ and fields produced by all other polarized dipoles in the material. For cubic crystals, the **Lorentz field** model states $\mathbf{E}_{loc} = \mathbf{E}_{ext} + \frac{\mathbf{P}}{3\epsilon_0}$. This internal field dictates the atomic polarizability, which then relates to macroscopic dielectric properties via the Clausius-Mossotti relation.

See [[Semester 1/Physics/Unit 4/Core Notes#102-internal-fields-in-dielectrics\|Core Notes.md]] for a detailed explanation and derivation of the Lorentz field and Clausius-Mossotti relation.

## 11. Non-Linear Dielectrics

### 45. Non-Linear dielectrics – Electro strictive responses, non-centro symmetry in crystals, Piezo electric materials, Pyro electric materials, phase transitions.

#### Answer
*   **Non-Linear Dielectrics**: Materials where polarization ($\mathbf{P}$) is not linearly proportional to the applied electric field ($\mathbf{E}$), requiring higher-order susceptibility terms ($\chi^{(2)}, \chi^{(3)}$).
*   **Electrostriction**: Universal property of all dielectrics; a strain proportional to $E^2$, independent of field direction.
*   **Non-Centrosymmetry**: Lack of a center of inversion symmetry in a crystal. A prerequisite for even-order non-linear effects ($\chi^{(2)}$), piezoelectricity, and pyroelectricity.
*   **Piezoelectric Materials**: Non-centrosymmetric crystals that generate electric charge under mechanical stress and deform under an electric field (linear electromechanical coupling).
*   **Pyroelectric Materials**: A subset of piezoelectric materials with a spontaneous electric polarization ($\mathbf{P}_s$) that changes with temperature.
*   **Phase Transitions**: Temperature-dependent changes in crystal structure and symmetry (e.g., at Curie temperature $T_C$) that cause shifts between paraelectric, pyroelectric, and ferroelectric phases, creating or removing spontaneous polarization.

See [[Semester 1/Physics/Unit 4/Core Notes#11-non-linear-dielectrics\|Core Notes.md]] for detailed explanations of these concepts.

### 46. Write the interrelations amongst ferroelectricity, pyroelectricity and piezoelectricity.

#### Answer
These phenomena form a hierarchical relationship based on crystal symmetry:
1.  **Piezoelectric materials** are **non-centrosymmetric crystals** (20 classes) that exhibit an electric response to mechanical stress and vice-versa.
2.  **Pyroelectric materials** are a subset of piezoelectric materials (10 classes) that possess a **spontaneous electric polarization ($\mathbf{P}_s$)** due to a unique polar axis, and this $\mathbf{P}_s$ changes with temperature.
3.  **Ferroelectric materials** are a subset of pyroelectric materials (10 classes) where the **spontaneous polarization can be reversed or switched** by an external electric field, leading to hysteresis.

Therefore: All ferroelectrics are pyroelectric, and all pyroelectrics are piezoelectric. All piezoelectric materials are non-centrosymmetric.

See [[Semester 1/Physics/Unit 4/Core Notes#116-interrelations-amongst-ferroelectricity-pyroelectricity-and-piezoelectricity\|Core Notes.md]] for full details, including a diagram.

### 47. What are sensors and actuators? Write a note.

#### Answer
*   **Sensors**: Devices that detect and measure a physical quantity (e.g., pressure, temperature, light, sound) and convert it into an electrical signal. Piezoelectric materials are used as sensors (e.g., pressure sensors, microphones) by utilizing their direct piezoelectric effect.
*   **Actuators**: Devices that convert an electrical signal into a physical output, typically mechanical motion or force. Piezoelectric materials are used as actuators (e.g., ultrasonic transducers, precision positioners) by utilizing their converse piezoelectric effect.

## 12. Ferroelectrics

### 48. Ferro electrics, BaTiO3 structure, hysteresis and application as memory materials.

#### Answer
**Ferroelectrics** are pyroelectric materials with a spontaneous electric polarization ($\mathbf{P}_s$) that can be reversed by an electric field, exhibiting a **hysteresis loop** (P-E loop). **$\text{BaTiO}_3$** is a classic example, transforming from cubic (paraelectric, centrosymmetric) above $T_C (\approx 120^\circ C)$ to tetragonal (ferroelectric, non-centrosymmetric) below $T_C$ due to $\text{Ti}^{4+}$ ion shifts. The hysteresis loop (showing remnant polarization $P_r$ and coercive field $E_c$) enables their use in **non-volatile memory (FeRAM)**, where $+P_r$ and $-P_r$ states store binary information, retained even without power.

See [[Semester 1/Physics/Unit 4/Core Notes#12-ferroelectrics\|Core Notes.md]] for detailed explanations, diagrams, and applications.

### 49. What structural changes are observed in BaTiO3 with change in temperature and explain why it losses spontaneous polarization above Curie temperature.

#### Answer
Below its Curie temperature ($\approx 120^\circ C$), $\text{BaTiO}_3$ undergoes displacive phase transitions to lower-symmetry ferroelectric phases (tetragonal, orthorhombic, rhombohedral), where the $\text{Ti}^{4+}$ ion shifts slightly off-center within the oxygen octahedron, creating a spontaneous electric dipole moment. Above the Curie temperature, it transitions to a **cubic perovskite structure**, which is **centrosymmetric**. In this high-symmetry configuration, the $\text{Ti}^{4+}$ ion is perfectly centered, meaning there is no net uncompensated displacement of charges, and therefore, the material loses its spontaneous polarization, behaving as a paraelectric.

See [[Semester 1/Physics/Unit 4/Core Notes#122-batio3-structure-and-phase-transitions\|Core Notes.md]] for details.

### 50. In what way do ferroelectrics differ from ordinary dielectrics?

#### Answer
Ferroelectrics differ from ordinary dielectrics in three key ways:
1.  **Spontaneous Polarization**: Ferroelectrics possess a **spontaneous electric polarization ($\mathbf{P}_s$)** below a certain temperature (Curie temperature), even in the absence of an external electric field. Ordinary dielectrics only exhibit induced polarization in the presence of an external field.
2.  **Hysteresis**: When the polarization of a ferroelectric is plotted against an applied electric field (P-E curve), it exhibits a characteristic **hysteresis loop**, indicating that the polarization state depends on the material's history and the field applied. Ordinary dielectrics show a linear P-E relationship (unless under very high fields where electrostriction/non-linearity might occur, but without P_s and switchability).
3.  **Polarization Switching**: The spontaneous polarization in ferroelectrics can be **reversed or switched** by an external electric field. Ordinary dielectrics cannot be electrically-switched to retain a polarization state.

See [[Semester 1/Physics/Unit 4/Core Notes#121-ferroelectrics\|Core Notes.md]] and [[Semester 1/Physics/Unit 4/Core Notes#123-hysteresis-p-e-loop\|Core Notes.md]] for further distinctions.

### 51. Based on the hysteresis curves classify magnetic materials.

#### Answer
*(Note: This unit focuses on dielectric materials. For ferroelectric materials, hysteresis curves help classify them based on their properties.)*

Based on the **P-E hysteresis curves, ferroelectric materials** can be classified by their key parameters:
1.  **Soft Ferroelectrics**: Characterized by a **narrow hysteresis loop** with a low coercive field ($E_c$) and high remnant polarization ($P_r$). They are easily switchable and useful for memories and low-power applications (e.g., some perovskites).
2.  **Hard Ferroelectrics**: Characterized by a **broad hysteresis loop** with a high coercive field ($E_c$) and often high remnant polarization ($P_r$). They are difficult to switch but ideal for applications requiring stable polarization and high piezoelectric responses, such as high-power transducers and sensors (e.g., PZT).
3.  **Relaxor Ferroelectrics**: Exhibit diffuse phase transitions and frequency-dependent permittivity/polarization, with slim, often asymmetric hysteresis loops.

If the question intended magnetic materials, a similar principle applies:
*   **Soft Magnetic Materials**: Narrow hysteresis loop, low coercivity, easily magnetized/demagnetized, useful for transformers, inductors.
*   **Hard Magnetic Materials**: Wide hysteresis loop, high coercivity, difficult to demagnetize, used for permanent magnets.

See [[Semester 1/Physics/Unit 4/Core Notes#123-hysteresis-p-e-loop\|Core Notes.md]] for an explanation of ferroelectric hysteresis.

## 13. Non-Linear Optics (NLO) and Second Harmonic Generation (SHG)

### 52. Non-Linear Optics (NLO) and Second Harmonic Generation (SHG).

#### Answer
**Non-Linear Optics (NLO)** is the study of light-matter interactions where the material's polarization ($\mathbf{P}$) responds non-linearly to the incident light's electric field ($\mathbf{E}$), usually at high laser intensities. This is described by higher-order susceptibility tensors ($\chi^{(2)}, \chi^{(3)}$). **Second Harmonic Generation (SHG)** is a second-order NLO process where two photons of frequency $\omega$ combine in a **non-centrosymmetric** material to produce one photon of frequency $2\omega$ (frequency doubling). It requires phase matching for efficient conversion and is used for laser wavelength conversion.

# Unit 7: Lasers, Optoelectronics, and Advanced Materials - Examples

This section provides step-by-step solutions to numerical and conceptual problems related to laser physics, dielectrics, and optoelectronics, as outlined in the `Core Notes.md`.

## Solved Numericals (from provided context)

### Example 1: Population of Higher Energy State

**Problem (SN-1):** An emission system has two levels which gives rise to an emission wavelength of 546.1 nm. If the population of the lower state is $4 \times 10^{22}$ at 600 K, estimate the population of the higher energy state.

**Solution:**
1.  **Recall Boltzmann Distribution Law:**
    The ratio of populations of two energy states $N_1$ (lower) and $N_2$ (higher) at thermal equilibrium is given by:
    $$ \frac{N_2}{N_1} = e^{-\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k_B T}} = e^{-\frac{h\nu}{k_B T}} $$
    where $h\nu = hc/\lambda$ for photon energy.

2.  **Given Values:**
    *   Wavelength ($\lambda$) = 546.1 nm = $546.1 \times 10^{-9}$ m
    *   Population of lower state ($N_1$) = $4 \times 10^{22}$
    *   Temperature ($T$) = 600 K
    *   Planck's constant ($h$) = $6.626 \times 10^{-34}$ J s
    *   Speed of light ($c$) = $3 \times 10^8$ m/s
    *   Boltzmann constant ($k_B$) = $1.38 \times 10^{-23}$ J/K

3.  **Calculate the exponent term $\frac{h\nu}{k_B T}$:**
    $$ \frac{h\nu}{k_B T} = \frac{hc}{\lambda k_B T} $$
    $$ \frac{hc}{\lambda k_B T} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J s}) \times (3 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s})}{(546.1 \times 10^{-9} \text{ m}) \times (1.38 \times 10^{-23} \text{ J/K}) \times (600 \text{ K})} $$
    $$ \frac{hc}{\lambda k_B T} = \frac{1.9878 \times 10^{-25}}{4.52628 \times 10^{-27}} \approx 43.918 $$

4.  **Calculate the population ratio $\frac{N_2}{N_1}$:**
    $$ \frac{N_2}{N_1} = e^{-43.918} $$
    $$ e^{-43.918} \approx 8.088 \times 10^{-20} $$

5.  **Estimate the population of the higher energy state ($N_2$):**
    $$ N_2 = N_1 \times e^{-\frac{h\nu}{k_B T}} $$
    $$ N_2 = (4 \times 10^{22}) \times (8.088 \times 10^{-20}) $$
    $$ N_2 = 3.2352 \times 10^{3} $$

**Final Answer:** The population of the higher energy state is approximately $3.2352 \times 10^{3}$.

### Example 2: Emission Wavelength and A/B Ratio

**Problem (SN-2):** The ratio of population between the high energy state to the lower energy state is $5 \times 10^{-19}$ at 400K. Find the emission wavelength between two states and the ratio A/B.

**Solution:**
1.  **Given Values:**
    *   Ratio of populations $\frac{N_2}{N_1} = 5 \times 10^{-19}$
    *   Temperature ($T$) = 400 K
    *   Planck's constant ($h$) = $6.626 \times 10^{-34}$ J s
    *   Speed of light ($c$) = $3 \times 10^8$ m/s
    *   Boltzmann constant ($k_B$) = $1.38 \times 10^{-23}$ J/K

2.  **Recall Boltzmann Distribution Law and solve for $\lambda$:**
    $$ \frac{N_2}{N_1} = e^{-\frac{h\nu}{k_B T}} = e^{-\frac{hc}{\lambda k_B T}} $$
    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:
    $$ \ln\left(\frac{N_2}{N_1}\right) = -\frac{hc}{\lambda k_B T} $$
    $$ \lambda = -\frac{hc}{k_B T \ln\left(\frac{N_2}{N_1}\right)} $$
    Substitute the given values:
    $$ \lambda = -\frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J s}) \times (3 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s})}{(1.38 \times 10^{-23} \text{ J/K}) \times (400 \text{ K}) \times \ln(5 \times 10^{-19})} $$
    First, calculate $\ln(5 \times 10^{-19})$:
    $$ \ln(5 \times 10^{-19}) = \ln(5) + \ln(10^{-19}) = 1.609 - 19 \ln(10) = 1.609 - 19 \times 2.3026 \approx 1.609 - 43.7494 = -42.1404 $$
    Now, substitute back into the equation for $\lambda$:
    $$ \lambda = -\frac{1.9878 \times 10^{-25}}{(1.38 \times 10^{-23}) \times (400) \times (-42.1404)} $$
    $$ \lambda = -\frac{1.9878 \times 10^{-25}}{(-2.327 \times 10^{-20})} \approx 8.542 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m} $$
    $$ \lambda = 8542 \text{ nm} \text{ or } 8.542 \text{ µm} $$
    The calculation in the OCR derived $N_1/N_2 = 2 \times 10^{18}$ and then $\lambda = 854.56 \text{ nm}$. Let's recheck with the OCR approach using $N_1/N_2$ and $hc/(kT \ln(N_1/N_2))$.
    From the given source, it implies $N_1/N_2 = \exp(h\nu/kT)$.
    So $N_1/N_2 = 1/(5 \times 10^{-19}) = 2 \times 10^{18}$.
    Then $\ln(N_1/N_2) = \ln(2 \times 10^{18}) = \ln(2) + 18 \ln(10) = 0.693 + 18 \times 2.3026 \approx 0.693 + 41.4468 = 42.1398$.
    $$ \lambda = \frac{hc}{k_B T \ln\left(\frac{N_1}{N_2}\right)} = \frac{1.9878 \times 10^{-25} \text{ J m}}{(1.38 \times 10^{-23} \text{ J/K}) \times (400 \text{ K}) \times (42.1398)} $$
    $$ \lambda = \frac{1.9878 \times 10^{-25}}{2.324 \times 10^{-20}} \approx 8.553 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m} = 8553 \text{ nm} $$
    The OCR result of 854.56 nm is inconsistent with $N_2/N_1 = 5 \times 10^{-19}$ at 400K unless perhaps a different temperature or ratio was intended for that specific number. However, following the current problem statement leads to ~8.5 µm. The OCR calculation `hc/(kT*ln(N1/N2))` is correct using the proper logarithm argument. Let's use the wavelength derived from the OCR itself for the next step, assuming it implies that specific result, regardless of the intermediate calculation shown. If we strictly follow the value $\lambda = 854.56 \text{ nm}$ from the OCR and trace back:
    $ E_2-E_1 = hc/\lambda = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (854.56e-9) = 2.326e-19 J$.
    $ k_B T \ln(N_1/N_2) = (1.38e-23 * 400) * \ln(2e18) = 5.52e-21 * 42.1398 = 2.326e-19 J$.
    So the OCR's $\lambda = 854.56 \text{ nm}$ is indeed obtained IF $N_1/N_2 = 2 \times 10^{18}$ and $T=400K$ is used for the direct calculation of $\lambda$. The text stated $N_2/N_1 = 5 \times 10^{-19}$, which implies $N_1/N_2 = 2 \times 10^{18}$. The calculation is sound.

3.  **Calculate the ratio $A_{21}/B_{21}$ (A/B ratio):**
    Recall Einstein's relation:
    $$ \frac{A_{21}}{B_{21}} = \frac{8\pi h \nu^3}{c^3} = \frac{8\pi h (c/\lambda)^3}{c^3} = \frac{8\pi h}{\lambda^3} $$
    Using $\lambda = 854.56 \text{ nm} = 854.56 \times 10^{-9} \text{ m}$ as per the OCR's result.
    $$ \frac{A_{21}}{B_{21}} = \frac{8\pi \times (6.626 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J s})}{(854.56 \times 10^{-9} \text{ m})^3} $$
    $$ \frac{A_{21}}{B_{21}} = \frac{1.664 \times 10^{-32}}{(854.56)^3 \times 10^{-27}} = \frac{1.664 \times 10^{-32}}{6.242 \times 10^8 \times 10^{-27}} $$
    $$ \frac{A_{21}}{B_{21}} = \frac{1.664 \times 10^{-32}}{6.242 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 2.666 \times 10^{-14} \text{ s}^{-1} \text{ (J m}^{-3} \text{ s Hz})^{-1} $$
    The unit for $A_{21}/B_{21}$ is $[Time]^{-1} / ([Mass]^{-1}[Length][Time]) = [Mass][Time]^{-2}[Length]^{-1}$. This can be confusing across different unit systems. The original context gave $\frac{A_{21}}{B_{21}} = \frac{8\pi h \nu^3}{c^3}$ which has units of $J s m^{-3}$ for spectral energy density.
    So, the dimensions are $\frac{\text{Energy} \cdot \text{Volume}^{-1} \cdot \text{Frequency}^{-1}}{\text{Frequency}^{-1}} = \text{Energy} \cdot \text{Volume}^{-1}$, or $\text{J m}^{-3}$.
    Let's re-evaluate the units. $A_{21}$ is $s^{-1}$. $B_{21}$ is $\text{m}^3 \text{ J}^{-1} \text{ s}^{-1}$. So $A_{21}/B_{21}$ unit is $s^{-1} / (\text{m}^3 \text{ J}^{-1} \text{ s}^{-1}) = \text{J m}^{-3}$.
    So the result is $2.666 \times 10^{-14} \text{ J/m}^3$.

**Final Answer:**
*   The emission wavelength is $\lambda = 854.56 \text{ nm}$.
*   The ratio $A_{21}/B_{21}$ is approximately $2.666 \times 10^{-14} \text{ J/m}^3$.

### Example 3: Wavelength and Energy Density of Radiation

**Problem (SN-3):** The ratio of population of the upper excited state to the lower energy state in a system at 300K is found to be $1.2 \times 10^{-19}$. Find the wavelength of the radiation emitted and the energy density of radiation.

**Solution:**
1.  **Given Values:**
    *   Ratio of populations $\frac{N_2}{N_1} = 1.2 \times 10^{-19}$
    *   Temperature ($T$) = 300 K
    *   Planck's constant ($h$) = $6.626 \times 10^{-34}$ J s
    *   Speed of light ($c$) = $3 \times 10^8$ m/s
    *   Boltzmann constant ($k_B$) = $1.38 \times 10^{-23}$ J/K

2.  **Calculate Wavelength ($\lambda$):**
    Using the Boltzmann distribution:
    $$ \frac{N_2}{N_1} = e^{-\frac{hc}{\lambda k_B T}} $$
    $$ \ln\left(\frac{N_2}{N_1}\right) = -\frac{hc}{\lambda k_B T} $$
    $$ \lambda = -\frac{hc}{k_B T \ln\left(\frac{N_2}{N_1}\right)} $$
    First, calculate $\ln(1.2 \times 10^{-19})$:
    $$ \ln(1.2 \times 10^{-19}) = \ln(1.2) + \ln(10^{-19}) = 0.1823 - 19 \ln(10) = 0.1823 - 19 \times 2.3026 \approx 0.1823 - 43.7494 = -43.5671 $$
    Now, substitute back into the equation for $\lambda$:
    $$ \lambda = -\frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J s}) \times (3 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s})}{(1.38 \times 10^{-23} \text{ J/K}) \times (300 \text{ K}) \times (-43.5671)} $$
    $$ \lambda = -\frac{1.9878 \times 10^{-25}}{(-1.804 \times 10^{-19})} \approx 1.101 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m} $$
    $$ \lambda \approx 1.101 \text{ µm} $$
    The OCR states $\lambda=1.06 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}$. Let's recalculate carefully.
    $k_B T = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \times 300 = 4.14 \times 10^{-21} \text{ J}$.
    $h \times c = 1.9878 \times 10^{-25} \text{ J m}$.
    $\ln(N_2/N_1) = \ln(1.2 \times 10^{-19}) = -43.5671$.
    $\lambda = -\frac{1.9878 \times 10^{-25}}{(4.14 \times 10^{-21}) \times (-43.5671)} = -\frac{1.9878 \times 10^{-25}}{-1.8037 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 1.102 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}$.
    This is close to 1.1 µm. The OCR value of `1.06x10^-6 m` seems to be a slight rounding/approximation in their intermediate steps or using slightly different constants. We will adhere to the calculated value.

3.  **Calculate the energy density of radiation $\rho(\nu)$ (or $u(\nu)$) using Planck's formula:**
    $$ \rho(\nu) = \frac{8\pi h \nu^3}{c^3} \frac{1}{e^{h\nu/k_B T} - 1} $$
    First, calculate $\nu = c/\lambda$:
    $$ \nu = \frac{3 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}}{1.102 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}} = 2.722 \times 10^{14} \text{ Hz} $$
    Then, $h\nu = (6.626 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J s}) \times (2.722 \times 10^{14} \text{ Hz}) = 1.803 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J}$.
    Now, the exponent term $h\nu / (k_B T)$:
    $$ \frac{h\nu}{k_B T} = \frac{1.803 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J}}{(1.38 \times 10^{-23} \text{ J/K}) \times (300 \text{ K})} = \frac{1.803 \times 10^{-19}}{4.14 \times 10^{-21}} \approx 43.55 $$
    We can also note that $\frac{h\nu}{k_B T} = -\ln(N_2/N_1) = 43.5671$. This is consistent.
    Now compute $\rho(\nu)$:
    $$ \rho(\nu) = \frac{8\pi (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) (2.722 \times 10^{14})^3}{(3 \times 10^8)^3} \frac{1}{e^{43.5671} - 1} $$
    $$ \rho(\nu) = \frac{8\pi (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) (2.016 \times 10^{43})}{2.7 \times 10^{25}} \frac{1}{e^{43.5671} - 1} $$
    $$ \rho(\nu) = \frac{3.342 \times 10^{11}}{2.7 \times 10^{25}} \frac{1}{e^{43.5671} - 1} $$
    Since $e^{43.5671}$ is a very large number, $e^{43.5671} - 1 \approx e^{43.5671} \approx 6.09 \times 10^{18}$.
    $$ \rho(\nu) \approx (1.238 \times 10^{-14}) \times \frac{1}{6.09 \times 10^{18}} \approx 2.03 \times 10^{-33} \text{ J s/m}^3 $$
    The dimensions of $u(\nu)$ or $\rho(\nu)$ are spectral energy density, which are "Energy per unit volume per unit frequency" so J s m$^{-3}$ (J/(m$^3$ Hz)). The OCR provides $1.987 \times 10^{-33} \text{ Js/m}^3$. Our calculated value is very close considering approximations.

**Final Answer:**
*   The wavelength of radiation emitted is $\lambda \approx 1.102 \text{ µm}$ (or $1.102 \times 10^{-6}$ m).
*   The energy density of radiation is $\rho(\nu) \approx 2.03 \times 10^{-33} \text{ J s/m}^3$.

### Example 4: Wavelength of Laser Emitted from Semiconductor

**Problem (SN-4/CL43_Q3):** A laser emission from a certain laser has an output power of 10 milli watts. If the wavelength of the emission is 632.8 nm, find the rate of emission of the stimulated photons. If the band gap of direct band gap semiconductor is 0.2 eV, estimate the wavelength of laser emitted from it. To which region of electromagnetic spectrum does it belong?

**Solution - Part 1: Rate of emission for existing laser**
1.  **Given Values:**
    *   Output power ($P$) = 10 mW = $10 \times 10^{-3}$ W
    *   Wavelength ($\lambda$) = 632.8 nm = $632.8 \times 10^{-9}$ m
    *   Planck's constant ($h$) = $6.626 \times 10^{-34}$ J s
    *   Speed of light ($c$) = $3 \times 10^8$ m/s

2.  **Recall the relationship between Power, Rate of Photons, and Photon Energy:**
    The total power $(P)$ is the product of the rate of emission of photons ($n$) and the energy of a single photon ($h\nu$).
    $$ P = n \times h\nu = n \times \frac{hc}{\lambda} $$
3.  **Solve for the rate of emission of stimulated photons ($n$):**
    $$ n = \frac{P \lambda}{hc} $$
    $$ n = \frac{(10 \times 10^{-3} \text{ W}) \times (632.8 \times 10^{-9} \text{ m})}{(6.626 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J s}) \times (3 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s})} $$
    $$ n = \frac{6.328 \times 10^{-12}}{1.9878 \times 10^{-25}} \approx 3.183 \times 10^{13} \text{ photons/second} $$
    The OCR result is $3.18 \times 10^{16}$ per second. This suggests a unit difference (milliwatts vs. Watts, or a higher base value for P), or a numerical error in the OCR. Let's assume the power was in Watts, or that the constant used was different. If $P$ was $10 \text{ W}$ instead of $10 \text{ mW}$, then the result would be $3.18 \times 10^{16}$. Given the typical laser powers, 10 mW is more common for this type of problem, but the OCR's answer points to a higher power or error. Stick to calculation with mW.

**Solution - Part 2: Wavelength from Semiconductor Band Gap**
1.  **Given Values:**
    *   Band gap energy ($E_g$) = 0.2 eV
    *   Planck's constant ($h$) = $6.626 \times 10^{-34}$ J s
    *   Speed of light ($c$) = $3 \times 10^8$ m/s
    *   Charge of electron ($e$) = $1.602 \times 10^{-19}$ C (for eV to Joules conversion)

2.  **Convert Band Gap Energy to Joules:**
    $$ E_g = 0.2 \text{ eV} \times (1.602 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J/eV}) = 3.204 \times 10^{-20} \text{ J} $$
    The OCR used $3.2 \times 10^{-20} \text{ J}$.

3.  **Calculate the Wavelength ($\lambda$):**
    For a direct band gap semiconductor, the emitted photon energy is approximately equal to the band gap energy:
    $$ E_g = h\nu = \frac{hc}{\lambda} $$
    $$ \lambda = \frac{hc}{E_g} $$
    $$ \lambda = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J s}) \times (3 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s})}{3.204 \times 10^{-20} \text{ J}} $$
    $$ \lambda = \frac{1.9878 \times 10^{-25}}{3.204 \times 10^{-20}} \approx 6.204 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m} $$
    $$ \lambda \approx 6.204 \text{ µm} $$ (The OCR gives $6.211 \times 10^{-6}$ m, slight constant difference).

4.  **Identify the Electromagnetic Spectrum Region:**
    A wavelength of approximately $6.2 \text{ µm}$ (or $6204 \text{ nm}$) falls into the **infrared (IR) region** of the electromagnetic spectrum. It is in the longer wavelength side of the visible spectrum (which typically ends around 700-750 nm).

**Final Answer:**
*   The rate of emission of stimulated photons for the 10 mW, 632.8 nm laser is approximately $3.183 \times 10^{13}$ photons/second.
*   The wavelength of laser emitted from the semiconductor with a 0.2 eV band gap is approximately $6.204 \text{ µm}$. This light belongs to the **infrared region** of the electromagnetic spectrum.

### Example 5: Dielectric Properties with Charge Density

**Problem (S-1):** The surface density of charge of a parallel plate capacitor is $7.2 \times 10^{-10} \text{C m}^{-2}$. A dielectric medium with $\epsilon_r =12$ is introduced between the plates of the capacitor. Estimate the induced surface density of charge on the dielectric surface and the electric fields between the plates with and without the dielectric material.

**Solution:**
1.  **Given Values:**
    *   Surface charge density on capacitor plates ($\sigma_0$) = $7.2 \times 10^{-10} \text{ C/m}^2$
    *   Relative permittivity of dielectric ($\epsilon_r$) = 12
    *   Permittivity of free space ($\epsilon_0$) = $8.854 \times 10^{-12} \text{ F/m}$

2.  **Calculate Electric Field without Dielectric ($E_0$)**:
    In a parallel plate capacitor, the electric field in vacuum is given by:
    $$ E_0 = \frac{\sigma_0}{\epsilon_0} $$
    $$ E_0 = \frac{7.2 \times 10^{-10} \text{ C/m}^2}{8.854 \times 10^{-12} \text{ F/m}} \approx 81.32 \text{ V/m} $$
    (The OCR has 81.35 V/m, slight difference due to rounding of constants.)

3.  **Calculate Electric Field with Dielectric ($E$)**:
    When a dielectric is inserted, the electric field is reduced by a factor of $\epsilon_r$:
    $$ E = \frac{E_0}{\epsilon_r} $$
    $$ E = \frac{81.32 \text{ V/m}}{12} \approx 6.777 \text{ V/m} $$
    (The OCR has 6.78 V/m, consistent).

4.  **Calculate Induced Surface Charge Density ($\sigma_p$ or $P_s$)**:
    The induced surface charge density (polarization) is related to the electric field inside the dielectric and its susceptibility:
    $$ \sigma_p = P = \epsilon_0 (\epsilon_r - 1) E $$
    Alternatively, using $\sigma_p = \sigma_0 (1 - \frac{1}{\epsilon_r})$:
    $$ \sigma_p = \sigma_0 \left( 1 - \frac{1}{12} \right) = \sigma_0 \left( \frac{11}{12} \right) $$
    $$ \sigma_p = (7.2 \times 10^{-10} \text{ C/m}^2) \times \frac{11}{12} = 6.6 \times 10^{-10} \text{ C/m}^2 $$
    (This matches the OCR result of $6.6 \times 10^{-10} \text{ C m}^{-2}$.)

5.  **Calculate Electric Field due to Induced Charge (Depolarization Field $E_p$ or $E'$)**:
    The depolarization field is $E_p = \frac{\sigma_p}{\epsilon_0}$. The OCR showed $E_p = \frac{\sigma_p}{\epsilon_0} = \epsilon_0(\epsilon_r-1)E / \epsilon_0 = (\epsilon_r-1)E$.
    $$ E_p = \frac{6.6 \times 10^{-10} \text{ C/m}^2}{8.854 \times 10^{-12} \text{ F/m}} \approx 74.55 \text{ V/m} $$
    (The OCR has 74.57 V/m, consistent).
    Also, $E_0 = E + E_p$, so $81.32 \approx 6.777 + 74.55$, which is consistent.

**Final Answer:**
*   Electric field across the plates without dielectric ($E_0$) $\approx 81.32 \text{ V/m}$.
*   Electric field between the plates with dielectric ($E$) $\approx 6.78 \text{ V/m}$.
*   Induced surface charge density on the dielectric surface ($\sigma_p$) = $6.6 \times 10^{-10} \text{ C/m}^2$.

### Example 6: Electric Fields and Surface Charge in Dielectric Material

**Problem (S-2):** A dielectric medium with $\epsilon_r = 25$ is introduced between the plates of the capacitor with surface density of charge on the plates equal to $8.00 \times 10^{-10} \text{ C m}^{-2}$. Estimate the electric fields between the plates with and without the dielectric material and the surface density of charge on the dielectric.

**Solution:**
1.  **Given Values:**
    *   Surface charge density on capacitor plates ($\sigma_0$) = $8.00 \times 10^{-10} \text{ C/m}^2$
    *   Relative permittivity of dielectric ($\epsilon_r$) = 25
    *   Permittivity of free space ($\epsilon_0$) = $8.854 \times 10^{-12} \text{ F/m}$

2.  **Calculate Electric Field without Dielectric ($E_0$)**:
    $$ E_0 = \frac{\sigma_0}{\epsilon_0} $$
    $$ E_0 = \frac{8.00 \times 10^{-10} \text{ C/m}^2}{8.854 \times 10^{-12} \text{ F/m}} \approx 90.35 \text{ V/m} $$
    (The OCR has 90.40 V/m, very close.)

3.  **Calculate Electric Field with Dielectric ($E$)**:
    $$ E = \frac{E_0}{\epsilon_r} $$
    $$ E = \frac{90.35 \text{ V/m}}{25} \approx 3.614 \text{ V/m} $$
    (The OCR has 3.62 V/m, consistent.)

4.  **Calculate Induced Surface Charge Density ($\sigma_p$ or $P_s$)**:
    $$ \sigma_p = \sigma_0 \left( 1 - \frac{1}{\epsilon_r} \right) $$
    $$ \sigma_p = (8.00 \times 10^{-10} \text{ C/m}^2) \left( 1 - \frac{1}{25} \right) = (8.00 \times 10^{-10}) \times \frac{24}{25} $$
    $$ \sigma_p = 7.68 \times 10^{-10} \text{ C/m}^2 $$
    (This matches the OCR result of $7.68 \times 10^{-10} \text{ C m}^{-2}$.)

5.  **Calculate Electric Field due to Induced Charge (Depolarization Field $E_p$ or $E'$)**:
    $$ E_p = \frac{\sigma_p}{\epsilon_0} $$
    $$ E_p = \frac{7.68 \times 10^{-10} \text{ C/m}^2}{8.854 \times 10^{-12} \text{ F/m}} \approx 86.74 \text{ V/m} $$
    (The OCR has 86.78 V/m, consistent).
    And $E_0 = E + E_p = 3.614 + 86.74 = 90.354 \text{ V/m}$, which is consistent.

**Final Answer:**
*   Electric field across the plates without dielectric ($E_0$) $\approx 90.35 \text{ V/m}$.
*   Electric field between the plates with dielectric ($E$) $\approx 3.61 \text{ V/m}$.
*   Induced surface charge density on the dielectric surface ($\sigma_p$) = $7.68 \times 10^{-10} \text{ C/m}^2$.

### Example 7: Electronic Polarisability of an Elemental Dielectric

**Problem (S-3/PS-3):** An elemental dielectric has $\epsilon_r = 10$ and contains $7.5 \times 10^{29}$ atoms/m$^3$. Calculate the electronic polarisability of the material.

**Solution:**
1.  **Given Values:**
    *   Relative permittivity ($\epsilon_r$) = 10
    *   Number of atoms per unit volume ($N$) = $7.5 \times 10^{29} \text{ atoms/m}^3$
    *   Permittivity of free space ($\epsilon_0$) = $8.854 \times 10^{-12} \text{ F/m}$

2.  **Recall the Clausius-Mossotti Relation:**
    For electronic polarizability, the Clausius-Mossotti relation is given by:
    $$ \frac{\epsilon_r - 1}{\epsilon_r + 2} = \frac{N \alpha_e}{3\epsilon_0} $$
    where $\alpha_e$ is the electronic polarizability.

3.  **Solve for $\alpha_e$:**
    $$ \alpha_e = \frac{3\epsilon_0}{N} \frac{\epsilon_r - 1}{\epsilon_r + 2} $$
    $$ \alpha_e = \frac{3 \times (8.854 \times 10^{-12} \text{ F/m})}{7.5 \times 10^{29} \text{ m}^{-3}} \times \frac{10 - 1}{10 + 2} $$
    $$ \alpha_e = \frac{2.6562 \times 10^{-11}}{7.5 \times 10^{29}} \times \frac{9}{12} $$
    $$ \alpha_e = (3.5416 \times 10^{-41} \text{ F m}^2) \times 0.75 $$
    $$ \alpha_e \approx 2.656 \times 10^{-41} \text{ F m}^2 $$
    (The OCR result is $10.62 \times 10^{-41} \text{ F m}^2$, which is significantly different. Let's recheck if there's an alternative formula or a typo in the OCR. The formula $P = \epsilon_0(\epsilon_r-1)E = N\alpha_e E$ leads to $\alpha_e = \epsilon_0(\epsilon_r-1)/N$. This is for microscopic polarizability under macroscopic field $E$. If we use this simplified relation (which is not Lorentz-corrected):
    $\alpha_e = \frac{(8.854 \times 10^{-12}) \times (10 - 1)}{7.5 \times 10^{29}} = \frac{8.854 \times 10^{-12} \times 9}{7.5 \times 10^{29}} = \frac{7.9686 \times 10^{-11}}{7.5 \times 10^{29}} \approx 10.6248 \times 10^{-41} \text{ F m}^2$.
    This implies the OCR solution used $\alpha_e = \epsilon_0(\epsilon_r-1)/N$, which essentially means it considered the local field to be equal to the macroscopic field ($E_{loc} = E$), implicitly ignoring the Lorentz correction $P/3\epsilon_0$. For many practical applications or simpler models, this approximation is sometimes used but is less accurate than Clausius-Mossotti for predicting intrinsic polarizability. However, since the OCR states this as its result, and it directly calculates it as $\frac{\epsilon_0 (\epsilon_r - 1)}{N}$, we will follow this path to match the OCR output for this specific problem, noting its departure from Clausius-Mossotti.)

**Final Answer:** The electronic polarisability of the material is $\alpha_e \approx 1.062 \times 10^{-40} \text{ F m}^2$.

## Problem Set (from provided context)

### Example 8: Degree of Non-Monochromaticity

**Problem (PS-8):** For an ordinary source, the coherence time $\tau_c = 10^{-10}$ second. Obtain the degree of non-monochromaticity for wavelength $\lambda_0 = 5400 \, \text{Å}$.

**Solution:**
1.  **Given Values:**
    *   Coherence time ($\tau_c$) = $10^{-10}$ s
    *   Center wavelength ($\lambda_0$) = $5400 \, \text{Å} = 5400 \times 10^{-10}$ m = $5.4 \times 10^{-7}$ m
    *   Speed of light ($c$) = $3 \times 10^8$ m/s

2.  **Recall relation for spectral linewidth and coherence time:**
    The spectral linewidth (bandwidth) $\Delta\nu$ is related to coherence time $\tau_c$ by:
    $$ \Delta\nu = \frac{1}{\tau_c} $$
    The linewidth in wavelength $\Delta\lambda$ is related to $\Delta\nu$ by:
    $$ |\Delta\nu| = \frac{c}{\lambda^2} |\Delta\lambda| \implies \Delta\lambda = \frac{\lambda^2}{c} \Delta\nu $$

3.  **Calculate $\Delta\nu$:**
    $$ \Delta\nu = \frac{1}{10^{-10} \text{ s}} = 10^{10} \text{ Hz} $$

4.  **Calculate $\Delta\lambda$:**
    $$ \Delta\lambda = \frac{(5.4 \times 10^{-7} \text{ m})^2}{3 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}} \times (10^{10} \text{ Hz}) $$
    $$ \Delta\lambda = \frac{29.16 \times 10^{-14}}{3 \times 10^8} \times 10^{10} = \frac{2.916 \times 10^{-13}}{3 \times 10^8} \times 10^{10} $$
    $$ \Delta\lambda = 9.72 \times 10^{-22} \times 10^{10} = 9.72 \times 10^{-12} \text{ m} $$
    $$ \Delta\lambda = 9.72 \times 10^{-2} \text{ Å} $$

5.  **Calculate the degree of non-monochromaticity (spectral purity):**
    The degree of non-monochromaticity is often expressed as $\Delta\lambda / \lambda_0$.
    $$ \text{Degree of non-monochromaticity} = \frac{\Delta\lambda}{\lambda_0} = \frac{9.72 \times 10^{-12} \text{ m}}{5.4 \times 10^{-7} \text{ m}} = 1.8 \times 10^{-5} $$

**Final Answer:**
*   The frequency linewidth is $\Delta\nu = 10^{10} \text{ Hz}$.
*   The wavelength linewidth is $\Delta\lambda = 9.72 \times 10^{-12} \text{ m}$ (or $0.0972 \, \text{Å}$).
*   The degree of non-monochromaticity (spectral purity) is $1.8 \times 10^{-5}$.

### Example 9: Coherence Length of a Laser Beam

**Problem (PS-9):** Calculate the coherence length of a laser beam for which the bandwidth $\Delta\nu = 3000 \text{ Hz}$.

**Solution:**
1.  **Given Values:**
    *   Bandwidth ($\Delta\nu$) = 3000 Hz
    *   Speed of light ($c$) = $3 \times 10^8$ m/s

2.  **Recall the formula for coherence length:**
    The coherence length ($L_c$) is given by:
    $$ L_c = \frac{c}{\Delta\nu} $$

3.  **Calculate $L_c$:**
    $$ L_c = \frac{3 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}}{3000 \text{ Hz}} = \frac{3 \times 10^8}{3 \times 10^3} \text{ m} = 1 \times 10^5 \text{ m} $$
    $$ L_c = 100 \text{ km} $$

**Final Answer:** The coherence length of the laser beam is $100 \text{ km}$.

### Example 10: Einstein Coefficients and Coherence Length

**Problem (PS-10):** The lifetime of transitions in a Na atom emitting wavelength of 589.6 nm is estimated to be 16.4 ns. Calculate the Einstein's coefficients A and B. Calculate spectral broadening and the coherence length of radiations.

**Solution:**
1.  **Given Values:**
    *   Lifetime ($\tau$) = 16.4 ns = $16.4 \times 10^{-9}$ s
    *   Wavelength ($\lambda$) = 589.6 nm = $589.6 \times 10^{-9}$ m
    *   Planck's constant ($h$) = $6.626 \times 10^{-34}$ J s
    *   Speed of light ($c$) = $3 \times 10^8$ m/s

2.  **Calculate Einstein Coefficient A ($A_{21}$):**
    The lifetime of a state is the inverse of the Einstein A coefficient for spontaneous emission:
    $$ A_{21} = \frac{1}{\tau} $$
    $$ A_{21} = \frac{1}{16.4 \times 10^{-9} \text{ s}} \approx 6.097 \times 10^7 \text{ s}^{-1} $$

3.  **Calculate Einstein Coefficient B ($B_{21}$ or $B_{12}$):**
    Recall Einstein's relation relating A and B coefficients:
    $$ \frac{A_{21}}{B_{21}} = \frac{8\pi h \nu^3}{c^3} = \frac{8\pi h}{\lambda^3} $$
    First, calculate the term $\frac{8\pi h}{\lambda^3}$:
    $$ \frac{8\pi h}{\lambda^3} = \frac{8\pi \times (6.626 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J s})}{(589.6 \times 10^{-9} \text{ m})^3} $$
    $$ \frac{8\pi h}{\lambda^3} = \frac{1.664 \times 10^{-32}}{(589.6)^3 \times 10^{-27}} = \frac{1.664 \times 10^{-32}}{2.046 \times 10^8 \times 10^{-27}} = \frac{1.664 \times 10^{-32}}{2.046 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 8.133 \times 10^{-14} \text{ J/m}^3 $$
    Now, solve for $B_{21}$:
    $$ B_{21} = \frac{A_{21}}{8.133 \times 10^{-14} \text{ J/m}^3} = \frac{6.097 \times 10^7 \text{ s}^{-1}}{8.133 \times 10^{-14} \text{ J/m}^3} \approx 7.496 \times 10^{20} \text{ m}^3 \text{ J}^{-1} \text{ s}^{-1} $$

4.  **Calculate Spectral Broadening (Frequency Linewidth $\Delta\nu$) and Coherence Length ($L_c$)**:
    The minimum possible frequency broadening (natural linewidth) is approximately $\Delta\nu = 1/\tau$. (More precisely, $\Delta\nu = A_{21} / 2\pi$ for Lorentzian, but $1/\tau$ is often used as a rough measure for coherence.)
    So, using $\Delta\nu \approx A_{21}$:
    $$ \Delta\nu \approx 6.097 \times 10^7 \text{ Hz} $$
    The coherence length $L_c$ is:
    $$ L_c = c \tau = (3 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}) \times (16.4 \times 10^{-9} \text{ s}) = 4.92 \text{ m} $$
    Alternatively, using $L_c = c/\Delta\nu$:
    $$ L_c = \frac{3 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}}{6.097 \times 10^7 \text{ Hz}} \approx 4.92 \text{ m} $$

**Final Answer:**
*   Einstein coefficient $A_{21} \approx 6.097 \times 10^7 \text{ s}^{-1}$.
*   Einstein coefficient $B_{21} \approx 7.496 \times 10^{20} \text{ m}^3 \text{ J}^{-1} \text{ s}^{-1}$.
*   Spectral broadening (frequency linewidth) $\Delta\nu \approx 6.097 \times 10^7 \text{ Hz}$.
*   Coherence length $L_c \approx 4.92 \text{ m}$.

### Example 11: He-Ne Laser Coherence

**Problem (PS-11):** The spectral line width of a He-Ne laser emitting 632.8 nm is $10^{-16}$ m. Calculate Einstein's coefficients A and B and the coherence length of radiations.

**Solution:**
1.  **Given Values:**
    *   Wavelength ($\lambda$) = 632.8 nm = $632.8 \times 10^{-9}$ m
    *   Spectral linewidth ($\Delta\lambda$) = $10^{-16}$ m
    *   Planck's constant ($h$) = $6.626 \times 10^{-34}$ J s
    *   Speed of light ($c$) = $3 \times 10^8$ m/s

2.  **Calculate Frequency Linewidth ($\Delta\nu$):**
    $$ \Delta\nu = \frac{c}{\lambda^2} \Delta\lambda $$
    $$ \Delta\nu = \frac{3 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}}{(632.8 \times 10^{-9} \text{ m})^2} \times (10^{-16} \text{ m}) $$
    $$ \Delta\nu = \frac{3 \times 10^8}{4.004 \times 10^{-13}} \times 10^{-16} = (7.492 \times 10^{20}) \times 10^{-16} $$
    $$ \Delta\nu \approx 7.492 \times 10^4 \text{ Hz} $$

3.  **Calculate Coherence Time ($\tau_c$) and Einstein A Coefficient ($A_{21}$):**
    For a laser, the coherence time is approximately $\tau_c = 1/\Delta\nu$. The Einstein A coefficient is equal to the inverse of the radiative lifetime, which for complex laser systems is effectively related to this coherence time.
    $$ \tau_c = \frac{1}{\Delta\nu} = \frac{1}{7.492 \times 10^4 \text{ Hz}} \approx 1.335 \times 10^{-5} \text{ s} $$
    Assuming for a resonant system that $A_{21} \approx \Delta\nu$:
    $$ A_{21} \approx 7.492 \times 10^4 \text{ s}^{-1} $$

4.  **Calculate Einstein B Coefficient ($B_{21}$):**
    $$ \frac{A_{21}}{B_{21}} = \frac{8\pi h}{\lambda^3} $$
    First, calculate the term $\frac{8\pi h}{\lambda^3}$:
    $$ \frac{8\pi h}{\lambda^3} = \frac{8\pi \times (6.626 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J s})}{(632.8 \times 10^{-9} \text{ m})^3} $$
    $$ \frac{8\pi h}{\lambda^3} = \frac{1.664 \times 10^{-32}}{(632.8)^3 \times 10^{-27}} = \frac{1.664 \times 10^{-32}}{2.536 \times 10^8 \times 10^{-27}} = \frac{1.664 \times 10^{-32}}{2.536 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.561 \times 10^{-14} \text{ J/m}^3 $$
    Now, solve for $B_{21}$:
    $$ B_{21} = \frac{A_{21}}{6.561 \times 10^{-14} \text{ J/m}^3} = \frac{7.492 \times 10^4 \text{ s}^{-1}}{6.561 \times 10^{-14} \text{ J/m}^3} \approx 1.142 \times 10^{18} \text{ m}^3 \text{ J}^{-1} \text{ s}^{-1} $$

5.  **Calculate Coherence Length ($L_c$)**:
    $$ L_c = c \tau_c = (3 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}) \times (1.335 \times 10^{-5} \text{ s}) \approx 4005 \text{ m} $$
    $$ L_c \approx 4.005 \text{ km} $$

**Final Answer:**
*   Einstein coefficient $A_{21} \approx 7.492 \times 10^4 \text{ s}^{-1}$.
*   Einstein coefficient $B_{21} \approx 1.142 \times 10^{18} \text{ m}^3 \text{ J}^{-1} \text{ s}^{-1}$.
*   Coherence length $L_c \approx 4005 \text{ m}$ (or $4.005 \text{ km}$).

### Example 12: Threshold Gain Factor for He-Ne Laser

**Problem (PS-12):** Calculate the threshold gain factor of a helium-neon laser, which has a loss factor of $0.05 \text{ m}^{-1}$ if the configuration of the system is as follows:
(a) A 50-cm tube with one mirror 99% reflecting and the output coupler 90% reflecting
(b) A 20-cm tube with one mirror 99% reflecting and the output coupler 95% reflecting
(c) A 20-cm tube with one mirror 99% reflecting and the output coupler 97% reflecting
Comment on the results obtained.

**Solution:**
The threshold gain coefficient ($g_{th}$) is given by:
$$ g_{th} = \alpha + \frac{1}{2L} \ln\left(\frac{1}{R_1 R_2}\right) $$
Where:
*   $\alpha$ is the internal loss factor = $0.05 \text{ m}^{-1}$
*   $L$ is the length of the gain medium (tube length)
*   $R_1$ is the reflectivity of the high reflector mirror
*   $R_2$ is the reflectivity of the output coupler mirror

**(a) Configuration 1:**
*   $L = 50 \text{ cm} = 0.5 \text{ m}$
*   $R_1 = 99\% = 0.99$
*   $R_2 = 90\% = 0.90$

Calculate $g_{th}$:
$$ g_{th} = 0.05 \text{ m}^{-1} + \frac{1}{2 \times 0.5 \text{ m}} \ln\left(\frac{1}{0.99 \times 0.90}\right) $$
$$ g_{th} = 0.05 + \frac{1}{1} \ln\left(\frac{1}{0.891}\right) $$
$$ g_{th} = 0.05 + \ln(1.1223) $$
$$ g_{th} = 0.05 + 0.1153 $$
$$ g_{th} = 0.1653 \text{ m}^{-1} $$

**(b) Configuration 2:**
*   $L = 20 \text{ cm} = 0.2 \text{ m}$
*   $R_1 = 99\% = 0.99$
*   $R_2 = 95\% = 0.95$

Calculate $g_{th}$:
$$ g_{th} = 0.05 \text{ m}^{-1} + \frac{1}{2 \times 0.2 \text{ m}} \ln\left(\frac{1}{0.99 \times 0.95}\right) $$
$$ g_{th} = 0.05 + \frac{1}{0.4} \ln\left(\frac{1}{0.9405}\right) $$
$$ g_{th} = 0.05 + 2.5 \ln(1.06326) $$
$$ g_{th} = 0.05 + 2.5 \times 0.0614 $$
$$ g_{th} = 0.05 + 0.1535 $$
$$ g_{th} = 0.2035 \text{ m}^{-1} $$

**(c) Configuration 3:**
*   $L = 20 \text{ cm} = 0.2 \text{ m}$
*   $R_1 = 99\% = 0.99$
*   $R_2 = 97\% = 0.97$

Calculate $g_{th}$:
$$ g_{th} = 0.05 \text{ m}^{-1} + \frac{1}{2 \times 0.2 \text{ m}} \ln\left(\frac{1}{0.99 \times 0.97}\right) $$
$$ g_{th} = 0.05 + \frac{1}{0.4} \ln\left(\frac{1}{0.9603}\right) $$
$$ g_{th} = 0.05 + 2.5 \ln(1.04134) $$
$$ g_{th} = 0.05 + 2.5 \times 0.0405 $$
$$ g_{th} = 0.05 + 0.10125 $$
$$ g_{th} = 0.15125 \text{ m}^{-1} $$

**Comment on the results obtained:**
*   **The threshold gain ($g_{th}$) represents the minimum gain per unit length that the active medium must provide to overcome all losses and sustain laser oscillations.**
*   **Case (a) has the longest cavity (0.5 m) and a relatively low output coupler reflectivity (90%).** This results in a moderate threshold gain ($0.1653 \text{ m}^{-1}$).
*   **Case (b) has a shorter cavity (0.2 m) than (a), but its output coupler (95%) is more reflective than (a)'s (90%).** The shorter cavity length *increases* the mirror loss term (due to the $1/2L$ factor), but the higher mirror reflectivity *decreases* the logarithm term. The combined effect is that case (b) has a higher threshold gain ($0.2035 \text{ m}^{-1}$) than case (a). This shows that increasing the mirror losses (either by higher transmission or shorter length) directly increases the gain required.
*   **Case (c) has the same short cavity length as (b) (0.2 m), but its output coupler (97%) is even *more* reflective than (b)'s (95%).** This significantly reduces the mirror loss term compared to (b). Consequently, case (c) has the lowest threshold gain ($0.15125 \text{ m}^{-1}$) among the three configurations.
*   **General conclusion:** A lower threshold gain means the laser is easier to achieve and requires less pump power. This is achieved by having lower total losses in the cavity, which predominantly comes from using higher reflectivity mirrors (especially for the output coupler) and longer cavity lengths (reducing the distributed mirror loss per unit length). Case (c) offers the easiest condition for laser operation by having the highest output coupler reflectivity. However, a very high output coupler reflectivity also means less light *exits* the cavity, potentially reducing usable output power, even if it makes reaching threshold easier. An optimal output coupler reflectivity is chosen to maximize output power.

**Final Answer:**
*   (a) $g_{th} = 0.1653 \text{ m}^{-1}$
*   (b) $g_{th} = 0.2035 \text{ m}^{-1}$
*   (c) $g_{th} = 0.15125 \text{ m}^{-1}$

### Example 13: Number of Modes and Frequency Separation in a Resonant Cavity

**Problem (CL40_Q3/PS-N):** Find the number of modes of the standing waves and their frequency separation in the resonant cavity of length 1m of He-Ne laser operating at wavelength of 632.8 nm.

**Solution:**
1.  **Given Values:**
    *   Cavity length ($L$) = 1 m
    *   Wavelength ($\lambda$) = 632.8 nm = $632.8 \times 10^{-9}$ m
    *   Speed of light ($c$) = $3 \times 10^8$ m/s

2.  **Calculate the number of modes ($m$)**:
    For a standing wave in a resonant cavity, the length $L$ must be an integer multiple of half the wavelength:
    $$ L = m \frac{\lambda}{2} $$
    $$ m = \frac{2L}{\lambda} $$
    $$ m = \frac{2 \times 1 \text{ m}}{632.8 \times 10^{-9} \text{ m}} = \frac{2}{632.8 \times 10^{-9}} \approx 3.160556 \times 10^6 $$
    Since $m$ must be an integer, this value represents the mode number of the specific wavelength being considered. If this were a laser that could only oscillate at this exact wavelength, these integers are its mode numbers.

3.  **Calculate the frequency separation between modes ($\Delta\nu_{FSR}$)**:
    The frequency separation between adjacent longitudinal modes (Free Spectral Range) is given by:
    $$ \Delta\nu_{FSR} = \frac{c}{2L} $$
    $$ \Delta\nu_{FSR} = \frac{3 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}}{2 \times 1 \text{ m}} = 1.5 \times 10^8 \text{ Hz} $$

**Final Answer:**
*   The mode number for the specified wavelength is $m \approx 3.16 \times 10^6$.
*   The frequency separation (Free Spectral Range) between adjacent modes is $1.5 \times 10^8 \text{ Hz}$.

### Example 14: Induced Surface Charge and Electric Fields

**Problem (PS-6):** A parallel plate capacitor without a dielectric is charged such that the surface charge density on the plates is $10^{-8} \text{ C m}^{-2}$. If a slab of a material with dielectric constant 10 is inserted between the plates, calculate the polarisation in the material and the electric field due to induced surface charge on the dielectric.

**Solution:**
1.  **Given Values:**
    *   Surface charge density on capacitor plates ($\sigma_0$) = $10^{-8} \text{ C/m}^2$
    *   Relative permittivity of dielectric ($\epsilon_r$) = 10
    *   Permittivity of free space ($\epsilon_0$) = $8.854 \times 10^{-12} \text{ F/m}$

2.  **Calculate Polarization in the Material ($P$)**:
    The polarization in the material is equal to the induced surface charge density ($\sigma_p$):
    $$ P = \sigma_p = \sigma_0 \left( 1 - \frac{1}{\epsilon_r} \right) $$
    $$ P = (10^{-8} \text{ C/m}^2) \left( 1 - \frac{1}{10} \right) = (10^{-8}) \times \frac{9}{10} $$
    $$ P = 9 \times 10^{-9} \text{ C/m}^2 $$

3.  **Calculate Electric Field due to Induced Surface Charge (Depolarization Field $E_p$)**:
    This is the electric field caused by the polarization charges themselves, often labeled as $E_p$ or $E'$.
    $$ E_p = \frac{\sigma_p}{\epsilon_0} $$
    $$ E_p = \frac{9 \times 10^{-9} \text{ C/m}^2}{8.854 \times 10^{-12} \text{ F/m}} \approx 1016.49 \text{ V/m} $$

**Final Answer:**
*   The polarization in the material is $9 \times 10^{-9} \text{ C/m}^2$.
*   The electric field due to induced surface charge on the dielectric is approximately $1016.5 \text{ V/m}$.

### Example 15: Polarisability of Oxygen Atom

**Problem (PS-5):** On being polarised an oxygen atom shows a dipole moment of $0.5 \times 10^{-22} \text{ C-m}$. If the distance of the center of the -ve charge cloud from the nucleus is $4 \times 10^{-17} \text{ m}$, calculate the polarisability of oxygen.

**Solution:**
1.  **Given Values:**
    *   Induced dipole moment ($p$) = $0.5 \times 10^{-22} \text{ C m}$
    *   Separation distance of charge ($d$) = $4 \times 10^{-17} \text{ m}$
    *   Charge on electron ($e$) = $1.602 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C}$

2.  **Calculate the induced electric field ($E_{loc}$ or $E$) within the atom:**
    The dipole moment $p$ is typically $q \times d$, where $q$ is the magnitude of the separated charge.
    Here, the problem states the dipole moment *is* $0.5 \times 10^{-22} \text{ C m}$ and asks for polarisability, which relates dipole moment to internal electric field, $p = \alpha E$.
    However, the structure of the question is a bit ambiguous. It describes a situation *where* an oxygen atom shows a certain dipole moment, and *if* "the distance of the center of the -ve charge cloud from the nucleus is...", this implies $d$ is given.
    Let's interpret the second part. The "distance of the center of the -ve charge cloud from the nucleus" ($4 \times 10^{-17} \text{ m}$) usually refers to the displacement of the electron cloud relative to the nucleus *under the influence of a field*.
    The induced dipole moment is $p = qd$. The induced electric field $E$ that causes this is
    This problem implicitly expects a field of a certain origin to be deduced from $d$. For an induced dipole, the displacing force is due to the electric field $\mathbf{E}$, and the restoring force is proportional to the displacement.
    The induced dipole moment $\mathbf{p} = \alpha_e \mathbf{E}_{loc}$.
    We need $E_{loc}$. If we consider a hydrogen-like model (which is often used for order-of-magnitude estimations), the electron cloud displacement $d$ from the nucleus of charge $Ze$ would lead to a restoring force. The electric field $E$ that induces a dipole moment $p = Ze d$ is balanced by this restoring force.
    Given $p=0.5 \times 10^{-22} \text{ C-m}$ and $d=4 \times 10^{-17} \text{ m}$.
    If we assume the dipole moment $p = qd$ where $q$ is the separated charge. For an atom, this $q$ is usually $Ze$ but here it implies a shift of a single effective charge.
    Let's assume the question implicitly refers to a context where the polarisability is related to the specific charge displacement by $p = \alpha E_{loc}$.
    The electric field $E$ required to move an electron (charge $e$) a distance $d$ from a nucleus (charge $e$) is roughly $E = \frac{e}{4\pi\epsilon_0 d^2}$.
    $$ E = \frac{1.602 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C}}{4\pi \times (8.854 \times 10^{-12} \text{ F/m}) \times (4 \times 10^{-17} \text{ m})^2} $$
    $$ E = \frac{1.602 \times 10^{-19}}{1.112 \times 10^{-10} \times 16 \times 10^{-34}} = \frac{1.602 \times 10^{-19}}{1.779 \times 10^{-43}} \approx 9.00 \times 10^{23} \text{ V/m} $$
    Then $\alpha = p/E = (0.5 \times 10^{-22}) / (9.00 \times 10^{23}) \approx 5.55 \times 10^{-47} \text{ F m}^2$. This seems too small.

    Let's consider the alternative interpretation: The "distance of the center of the -ve charge cloud from the nucleus IS $d$". This would imply that the actual field acting upon it to cause this is the unknown quantity.
    The previous definition of electronic polarizability $\alpha_e = 4\pi\epsilon_0 R^3$ is for an induced dipole proportional to volume.
    This question is likely hinting towards a simpler model of dipole formation used in derivations. An induced dipole moment $p = \alpha E$ where $E$ is the *local electric field*.
    If it's asking for the polarisability *given* the dipole moment for an oxygen atom, the $d$ information seems to be a distractor or for a different part of a problem not shown.
    Let's re-examine $4\pi\epsilon_0 R^3$. For oxygen atom, R is roughly 60 pm = $6 \times 10^{-11}$ m.
    $\alpha_e = 4\pi (8.854 \times 10^{-12}) (6 \times 10^{-11})^3 = 1.112 \times 10^{-10} \times 2.16 \times 10^{-31} \approx 2.4 \times 10^{-41} \text{ F m}^2$.

    The phrasing "If the distance... is 4x10^-17 m" is very specific. Let's assume this $d$ is the displacement of the electron cloud.
    The induced dipole moment for an atom is $p = (e') d$, where $e'$ is some effective charge. If we take $e'=e$:
    $p = e \times d_{displacement}$. This would mean $0.5 \times 10^{-22} = (1.602 \times 10^{-19}) \times d_{displacement}$. $d_{displacement}=(0.5/1.602) \times 10^{-3} = 3.12 \times 10^{-4}$ m, which is ridiculously large for an atom. So $d$ does not relate to $p$ as $ed$.

    Let's try: the electric field acting at the nucleus from displaced negative charge is $E_{nuc} = \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 d_{radius}^2}$. The question has given the dipole moment $p$. And then states if the distance of the center of negative charge cloud from the nucleus is $d$.
    This $d$ could be interpreted as the radius of the atom $R$. If so, the $p = \alpha E$ relation is more complex ($E$ refers to internal field components).
    Let's follow the standard interpretation for electronic polarizability and assume the $d$ in the question implies the actual displacement. Usually, the force balancing the electric force is from a Hooke's law type restoring force.
    Force from E: $F_E = eE$. Restoring force $F_R = Kd$. At equilibrium $eE = Kd$. So $eE = (Ke/K_0) d$, where $K_0$ some constant.
    This problem is ambiguous as stated without a model.
    Let's try to interpret this as a simple calculation of the magnitude of electric field that could induce such a dipole, and then use that field to calculate polarisability.
    If the charge separation is $d=4 \times 10^{-17}$ m and the dipole moment is $p=0.5 \times 10^{-22}$ C-m, then the magnitude of the separated charge is $q = p/d = (0.5 \times 10^{-22}) / (4 \times 10^{-17}) = 0.125 \times 10^{-5} \text{ C}$. This is extremely high; it suggests that the interpretation of $d$ is not a direct charge separation in the calculation of $p$.

    Let's assume the question meant a specific model: if an electric field $E$ induces a displacement $d$, then $p = \alpha_e E$. If we consider a simple model where an atom of radius $R_0$ has its electron cloud displaced by $d$ in field $E$, then $p = (Ze)d$. The internal field is roughly $E_{internal} = (\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}) \frac{Ze}{(R_0)^2}$.
    This problem needs clarification or a specific model assumed in the course.
    Let's simplify: A dipole moment $p = \alpha_e E$. We need $E$. The given $d$ is the radius of the electron cloud. Using the definition of point dipole $p = qd'$, where $d'$ is separation.
    What if the "distance of the center...from the nucleus is $4 \times 10^{-17} \text{ m}$" is actually the *displacement* $x$ in a field.
    Then the dipole moment is $p = qx$. If $q=e$, $p = e x$.
    $x = p/e = (0.5 \times 10^{-22}) / (1.602 \times 10^{-19}) = 3.12 \times 10^{-4}$ m. This can't be correct for an atom.

    Let's revert to a standard relation: $p = \alpha E$. If the external field is $E_{ext}$, and $d$ is the displacement of the electron cloud. Often, the displacement $d$ is given as $d = \frac{Ze_0}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{E}{K}$ where K is restoring force constant.
    Let's consider the problem from the textbook: "Electronic polarizability $\alpha_e$ can be calculated as $eR^3/\epsilon_0$ (not standard)."

    Let's try to infer from typical values. Electronic polarizability is on the order of $10^{-40}$ to $10^{-30} \text{ F m}^2$. The current phrasing makes it very hard to get a reasonable answer.
    What if "distance of the center of the -ve charge cloud from the nucleus is X" refers to the *equivalent* separation needed to produce the observed dipole for an electron charge?
    So, $p = e \times (\text{effective separation})$.
    $0.5 \times 10^{-22} \text{ C m} = (1.602 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C}) \times (\text{effective separation})$.
    Effective separation $= (0.5/1.602) \times 10^{-3} \text{ m} \approx 3.12 \times 10^{-4} \text{ m}$. This is still extremely large for an atom.

    Let's assume there is a typo in the question, or it implies a different constant.
    What if the $4 \times 10^{-17} \text{ m}$ is the *radius of the atom*?
    If we use a simple classical model for electronic polarization: an electron is displaced by an electric field $E$ in an atom of radius $R$. The induced dipole moment $p = e x$. The restoring force is $K x$. The electric field at the nucleus due to surface charges on sphere of radius $R$ shifted by distance $x$ induces internal field.
    The problem must be interpreted strictly. Given dipole moment $p$. Given a separate distance $d$. How do these relate to $\alpha$?
    The given $d$ looks like a very small distance, on the scale of nuclear dimensions. This cannot be an atomic radius or displacement.

    Given the context of other problems, it's possible this is a flawed question or from a model not provided. Without additional context on what $d=4 \times 10^{-17} \text{ m}$ represents in the calculation of polarisability *given* a dipole moment and *no external field*.
    If $d$ refers to displacement of electron cloud, then effective electric field is $E = (Zq) / (4\pi\epsilon_0 R^2)$ with restoring force $k d$.
    Let's assume the question implicitly means the classical model of electron cloud displacement. An electron is confined to an atom of radius R. When a field E is applied, it displaces by x. The restoring force is $k x$. The electric field is $E$. $p = ex$. $eE = kx$.
**Solution:**
1.  **Given Values:**
    *   Induced Dipole Moment ($p$) = $0.5 \times 10^{-22}$ C m
    *   Distance of center of negative charge from nucleus ($d$) = $4 \times 10^{-17}$ m
2.  **Formula & Ambiguity:**
    *   Electronic polarisability is defined by $\alpha_e = \frac{p}{E}$, where $E$ is the polarizing electric field. The problem does not explicitly state the electric field $E$.
    *   Alternatively, for a simple atomic model, $\alpha_e \approx 4\pi \epsilon_0 R^3$.
3.  **Analysis:**
    *   The given distance $d = 4 \times 10^{-17}$ m is extremely small (typical atomic radii are $\sim 10^{-10}$ m, and nuclear radii $\sim 10^{-15}$ m).
    *   If we interpret $d$ as the displacement $x$ in $p=q_{eff} x$, then $q_{eff} = p/d = 0.5 \times 10^{-22} / 4 \times 10^{-17} \approx 1.25 \times 10^{-6}$ C, which is much larger than the elementary charge $e$, implying a non-physical scenario for a single atom.
    *   If we assume $d$ to be a typo for an atomic dimension (e.g., $4 \times 10^{-11}$ m), we could estimate $\alpha$.
4.  **Conclusion:**
    *   Due to the likely typographical error in the "distance" value (orders of magnitude too small) and the absence of an external field value, a standard numerical answer cannot be calculated.
    *   However, the method would be: Determine $E$ (or $R$), then use $\alpha_e = p/E$ (or $4\pi \epsilon_0 R^3$).

### Example 16: Polarisability of Kr Atom

**Problem (PS-2):** Assuming that the polarisability of Kr atom is $2.18 \times 10^{-40} \text{ Fm}^2$, calculate its dielectric constant. Kr has $2.7 \times 10^{25}$ atoms per unit volume at NTP.

**Solution:**
1.  **Given Values:**
    *   Polarizability ($\alpha$) = $2.18 \times 10^{-40} \text{ F m}^2$ (Note: Unit here indicates polarizability is measured in $\text{F m}^2$, where F is Farad. $\text{F m}^2 = (\text{C}^2 \text{ N}^{-1} \text{ m}^{-2}) \text{ m}^2 = \text{C}^2 / \text{N}$. The correct unit for polarizability is $\text{C}^2 \text{ m/J}$ or $\text{F m}^2$ for this formulation, sometimes $\text{C m}^2/\text{V}$.)
    *   Number density ($N$) = $2.7 \times 10^{25} \text{ atoms/m}^3$
    *   Permittivity of free space ($\epsilon_0$) = $8.854 \times 10^{-12} \text{ F/m}$

2.  **Recall the Clausius-Mossotti Relation:**
    $$ \frac{\epsilon_r - 1}{\epsilon_r + 2} = \frac{N \alpha}{3\epsilon_0} $$

3.  **Calculate the right-hand side (RHS) of the Clausius-Mossotti Equation:**
    $$ \text{RHS} = \frac{(2.7 \times 10^{25} \text{ m}^{-3}) \times (2.18 \times 10^{-40} \text{ F m}^2)}{3 \times (8.854 \times 10^{-12} \text{ F/m})} $$
    $$ \text{RHS} = \frac{5.886 \times 10^{-15}}{2.6562 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 2.216 \times 10^{-4} $$

    Let $X = \text{RHS} = 2.216 \times 10^{-4}$.
    $$ \frac{\epsilon_r - 1}{\epsilon_r + 2} = X $$
    $$ \epsilon_r - 1 = X (\epsilon_r + 2) $$
    $$ \epsilon_r - 1 = X \epsilon_r + 2X $$
    $$ \epsilon_r (1 - X) = 1 + 2X $$
    $$ \epsilon_r = \frac{1 + 2X}{1 - X} $$
    $$ \epsilon_r = \frac{1 + 2 \times (2.216 \times 10^{-4})}{1 - (2.216 \times 10^{-4})} = \frac{1 + 0.0004432}{1 - 0.0002216} = \frac{1.0004432}{0.9997784} $$
    $$ \epsilon_r \approx 1.0006649 $$

**Final Answer:** The dielectric constant of Krypton is approximately $1.000665$.

### Example 17: Polarization of Water Droplet

**Problem (PS-1):** If the molecular dipoles in a $10^{-3} \text{ m}$ radius water drop are pointed in the same direction, calculate the polarisation of the water drop. Dipole moment of water molecule is $6 \times 10^{-30} \text{ Cm}$.

**Solution:**
1.  **Given Values:**
    *   Radius of water drop ($R$) = $10^{-3}$ m
    *   Dipole moment of a single water molecule ($\mu$) = $6 \times 10^{-30} \text{ C m}$
    *   Molar mass of water ($\text{H}_2\text{O}$) = 18.015 g/mol
    *   Density of water ($\rho_{water}$) = $1000 \text{ kg/m}^3$ (or $1 \text{ g/cm}^3$)
    *   Avogadro's number ($N_A$) = $6.022 \times 10^{23} \text{ mol}^{-1}$

2.  **Calculate the number of water molecules per unit volume (number density, $N$)**:
    $$ N = \frac{\rho_{water} \times N_A}{\text{Molar mass}} $$
    Molar mass in kg/mol: $18.015 \text{ g/mol} = 0.018015 \text{ kg/mol}$.
    $$ N = \frac{(1000 \text{ kg/m}^3) \times (6.022 \times 10^{23} \text{ mol}^{-1})}{0.018015 \text{ kg/mol}} $$
    $$ N \approx 3.343 \times 10^{28} \text{ molecules/m}^3 $$

3.  **Calculate the Polarization ($P$)**:
    If all molecular dipoles are pointed in the same direction (maximum alignment, or saturation polarization), the total polarization $P$ is the sum of individual dipole moments per unit volume:
    $$ P = N \times \mu $$
    $$ P = (3.343 \times 10^{28} \text{ m}^{-3}) \times (6 \times 10^{-30} \text{ C m}) $$
    $$ P \approx 2.0058 \times 10^{-1} \text{ C/m}^2 $$
    $$ P \approx 0.20 \text{ C/m}^2 $$
    The radius of the water drop is extraneous information here, as the question asks for polarization (dipole moment per unit volume), not the total dipole moment of the drop (which would involve volume).

**Final Answer:** The polarization of the water drop is approximately $0.20 \text{ C/m}^2$.

### Example 18: Polarization and Electric Field in a Capacitor

**Problem (PS-7):** A dielectric material has one species having an atomic polarizability value of $10^{-30} \text{ Cm}^2 \text{V}^{-1}$. It is found that when the dielectric sample is kept in a uniform electric field, the field reduces to one tenth of its original value. Estimate the number of atoms per unit volume of the material.

**Solution:**
1.  **Given Values:**
    *   Atomic polarizability ($\alpha$) = $10^{-30} \text{ C m}^2 \text{ V}^{-1}$
    *   Reduction in electric field: $E = \frac{1}{10} E_0$ (meaning $\epsilon_r = 10$)
        Therefore, Relative Permittivity ($\epsilon_r$) = 10
    *   Permittivity of free space ($\epsilon_0$) = $8.854 \times 10^{-12} \text{ F/m}$

2.  **Recall the Clausius-Mossotti Relation:**
    We need to find the number of atoms per unit volume ($N$). The Clausius-Mossotti relation is:
    $$ \frac{\epsilon_r - 1}{\epsilon_r + 2} = \frac{N \alpha}{3\epsilon_0} $$

3.  **Solve for $N$:**
    $$ N = \frac{3\epsilon_0}{\alpha} \frac{\epsilon_r - 1}{\epsilon_r + 2} $$
    $$ N = \frac{3 \times (8.854 \times 10^{-12} \text{ F/m})}{10^{-30} \text{ C m}^2 \text{ V}^{-1}} \times \frac{10 - 1}{10 + 2} $$
    $$ N = (2.6562 \times 10^{19} \text{ m}^{-3}) \times \frac{9}{12} $$
    $$ N = (2.6562 \times 10^{19}) \times 0.75 $$
    $$ N \approx 1.992 \times 10^{19} \text{ atoms/m}^3 $$

**Final Answer:** The number of atoms per unit volume of the material is approximately $1.992 \times 10^{19} \text{ atoms/m}^3$.

### Example 19: Electronic Polarisability of Sulphur

**Problem (PS-8):** Electronic polarisability of Sulphur is $3.28 \times 10^{-40} \text{ F-m}^2$. Calculate the dielectric constant of Sulphur if the density and atomic weight of Sulphur are $2.08 \times 10^3 \text{ kg-m}^3$ and 32 respectively.

**Solution:**
1.  **Given Values:**
    *   Electronic polarizability ($\alpha_e$) = $3.28 \times 10^{-40} \text{ F m}^2$
    *   Density ($\rho$) = $2.08 \times 10^3 \text{ kg/m}^3$
    *   Atomic weight ($M_a$) = 32 (g/mol or kg/kmol)
    *   Avogadro's number ($N_A$) = $6.022 \times 10^{23} \text{ mol}^{-1}$
    *   Permittivity of free space ($\epsilon_0$) = $8.854 \times 10^{-12} \text{ F/m}$

2.  **Calculate the number of atoms per unit volume ($N$)**:
    Atomic weight 32 suggests $32 \text{ g/mol} = 0.032 \text{ kg/mol}$.
    $$ N = \frac{\rho \times N_A}{M_a} $$
    $$ N = \frac{(2.08 \times 10^3 \text{ kg/m}^3) \times (6.022 \times 10^{23} \text{ mol}^{-1})}{0.032 \text{ kg/mol}} $$
    $$ N = \frac{1.252576 \times 10^{27}}{0.032} \approx 3.914 \times 10^{28} \text{ atoms/m}^3 $$

3.  **Recall the Clausius-Mossotti Relation:**
    $$ \frac{\epsilon_r - 1}{\epsilon_r + 2} = \frac{N \alpha_e}{3\epsilon_0} $$

4.  **Calculate the right-hand side (RHS) of the Clausius-Mossotti Equation:**
    $$ \text{RHS} = \frac{(3.914 \times 10^{28} \text{ m}^{-3}) \times (3.28 \times 10^{-40} \text{ F m}^2)}{3 \times (8.854 \times 10^{-12} \text{ F/m})} $$
    $$ \text{RHS} = \frac{1.284 \times 10^{-11}}{2.6562 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 0.4834 $$

5.  **Solve for $\epsilon_r$:**
    Let $X = \text{RHS} = 0.4834$.
    $$ \frac{\epsilon_r - 1}{\epsilon_r + 2} = X $$
    $$ \epsilon_r - 1 = X (\epsilon_r + 2) $$
    $$ \epsilon_r - 1 = X \epsilon_r + 2X $$
    $$ \epsilon_r (1 - X) = 1 + 2X $$
    $$ \epsilon_r = \frac{1 + 2X}{1 - X} $$
    $$ \epsilon_r = \frac{1 + 2 \times 0.4834}{1 - 0.4834} = \frac{1 + 0.9668}{0.5166} = \frac{1.9668}{0.5166} $$
    $$ \epsilon_r \approx 3.807 $$

**Final Answer:** The dielectric constant of Sulphur is approximately $3.807$.

### Example 20: Total Polarisability of $\text{CO}_2$

**Problem (PS-4):** Find the total polarisability of $\text{CO}_2$ if its susceptibility is $0.985 \times 10^{-3}$. Density of $\text{CO}_2$ is $1.977 \text{ Kg m}^{-3}$.

**Solution:**
1.  **Given Values:**
    *   Electric susceptibility ($\chi_e$) = $0.985 \times 10^{-3}$
    *   Density ($\rho$) = $1.977 \text{ kg/m}^3$
    *   Molar mass of $\text{CO}_2$ ($\text{C} + 2\text{O}$) = $12.011 + 2 \times 15.999 = 44.009 \text{ g/mol} = 0.044009 \text{ kg/mol}$
    *   Avogadro's number ($N_A$) = $6.022 \times 10^{23} \text{ mol}^{-1}$
    *   Permittivity of free space ($\epsilon_0$) = $8.854 \times 10^{-12} \text{ F/m}$

2.  **Calculate Relative Permittivity ($\epsilon_r$)**:
    $$ \epsilon_r = 1 + \chi_e $$
    $$ \epsilon_r = 1 + 0.985 \times 10^{-3} = 1 + 0.000985 = 1.000985 $$

3.  **Calculate the number of molecules per unit volume ($N$)**:
    $$ N = \frac{\rho \times N_A}{\text{Molar mass}} $$
    $$ N = \frac{(1.977 \text{ kg/m}^3) \times (6.022 \times 10^{23} \text{ mol}^{-1})}{0.044009 \text{ kg/mol}} $$
    $$ N = \frac{1.1802 \times 10^{24}}{0.044009} \approx 2.6817 \times 10^{25} \text{ molecules/m}^3 $$

4.  **Recall the Clausius-Mossotti Relation:**
    We need to find the total polarisability ($\alpha$).
    $$ \frac{\epsilon_r - 1}{\epsilon_r + 2} = \frac{N \alpha}{3\epsilon_0} $$

5.  **Solve for $\alpha$:**
    $$ \alpha = \frac{3\epsilon_0}{N} \frac{\epsilon_r - 1}{\epsilon_r + 2} $$
    $$ \alpha = \frac{3 \times (8.854 \times 10^{-12} \text{ F/m})}{2.6817 \times 10^{25} \text{ m}^{-3}} \times \frac{1.000985 - 1}{1.000985 + 2} $$
    $$ \alpha = \frac{2.6562 \times 10^{-11}}{2.6817 \times 10^{25}} \times \frac{0.000985}{3.000985} $$
    $$ \alpha \approx (9.905 \times 10^{-37} \text{ F m}^2) \times (0.000328) $$
    $$ \alpha \approx 3.249 \times 10^{-40} \text{ F m}^2 $$

**Final Answer:** The total polarisability of $\text{CO}_2$ is approximately $3.249 \times 10^{-40} \text{ F m}^2$.

## Assignment 4 Questions

### 57. Explain spatial coherence and temporal coherence properties of laser beam.

#### Answer
**Spatial Coherence:**
*   Refers to the correlation of the phase of the light wave at different **points in space** (transverse to direction of prop) at the **same time**.
*   A laser beam has high spatial coherence, meaning the wavefronts are perfectly uniform across the beam diameter.
*   **Measure:** High spatial coherence allows lasers to be focused to a tiny spot or stay collimated over long distances.

**Temporal Coherence:**
*   Refers to the correlation of the phase of the light wave at the **same point** in space at **different times** (along the direction of prop).
*   Related to the monochromaticity of the source. High temporal coherence means the wave stays a perfect sine wave for a long time (coherence time $\tau_c$) implies a very narrow frequency spread ($\Delta \nu$).
*   **Measure:** Coherence length ($L_c = c \tau_c$). Lasers can have $L_c$ of kilometers.

### 58. A pulsed laser emits photons of wavelength 780 nm with 20 mW average power. Calculate the number of photons contained in each pulse if the pulse duration is 10 ns.

#### Answer
This question phrasing is slightly ambiguous. "20 mW average power" usually implies continuous average. If it meant "peak pulse power is 20mW", it's one thing. If it's a rep-rate laser...
Assuming the **energy of one pulse** is derived from power: Energy = Power × Time.
(If 20mW is the peak power during the pulse):
1.  **Energy per pulse ($E_p$):**
    $E_p = P \times t = (20 \times 10^{-3} \text{ W}) \times (10 \times 10^{-9} \text{ s}) = 200 \times 10^{-12} \text{ J} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \text{ J}$.
2.  **Energy of one photon ($E_{ph}$):**
    $E_{ph} = \frac{hc}{\lambda}$.
    $E_{ph} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \times (3 \times 10^8)}{780 \times 10^{-9}} = \frac{19.878 \times 10^{-26}}{7.8 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 2.55 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J}$.
3.  **Number of photons ($N$):**
    $N = \frac{E_p}{E_{ph}} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-10}}{2.55 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 0.78 \times 10^9$.
    $$ N \approx 7.8 \times 10^8 \text{ photons} $$
(If 20mW is average power and repetition rate is unknown, we can't solve. Assuming Power refers to pulse power is standard for such simpler problems).

### 59. The lifetime of transitions in Na atoms emitting a wavelength of 589.6 nm is estimated to be 16.4 ns. Calculate the Einstein’s coefficients A and B. Calculate spectral broadening and the coherence length of radiations.

#### Answer
$\lambda = 589.6$ nm $= 5.896 \times 10^{-7}$ m. Lifetime $\tau_{sp} = 16.4$ ns $= 1.64 \times 10^{-8}$ s.

1.  **Einstein Coefficient A ($A_{21}$):**
    $A_{21} = \frac{1}{\tau_{sp}} = \frac{1}{1.64 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.1 \times 10^7 \text{ s}^{-1}$.
2.  **Einstein Coefficient B ($B_{21}$):**
    Relation: $\frac{A_{21}}{B_{21}} = \frac{8\pi h \nu^3}{c^3} = \frac{8\pi h}{\lambda^3}$.
    $B_{21} = A_{21} \frac{\lambda^3}{8\pi h}$.
    $B_{21} = (6.1 \times 10^7) \frac{(5.896 \times 10^{-7})^3}{8\pi (6.626 \times 10^{-34})}$.
    $\lambda^3 \approx 205 \times 10^{-21}$.
    $B_{21} = \frac{(6.1 \times 10^7)(2.05 \times 10^{-19})}{1.665 \times 10^{-32}} \approx \frac{12.5 \times 10^{-12}}{1.665 \times 10^{-32}} \approx 7.5 \times 10^{20} \text{ m}^3/(\text{J s}^2)$.
3.  **Spectral Broadening (Natural Linewidth $\Delta \nu$):**
    $\Delta \nu \approx \frac{1}{2\pi \tau} = \frac{1}{2\pi (1.64 \times 10^{-8})} \approx \frac{1}{10.3 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 9.7 \times 10^6 \text{ Hz}$ (or 9.7 MHz).
4.  **Coherence Length ($L_c$):**
    $L_c = c \tau_c$. Assuming $\tau_c \approx \tau_{sp}$ (for natural broadening limit).
    $L_c = (3 \times 10^8) \times (1.64 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 4.92 \text{ m}$.

### 60. Why is susceptibility treated as a tensor in anisotropic materials? Explain the tensor relation between polarization and electric field in anisotropic dielectrics.

#### Answer
**Why Tensor?**
In isotropic materials (like glass), the induced polarization $\mathbf{P}$ is always parallel to the applied electric field $\mathbf{E}$ ($\mathbf{P} = \epsilon_0 \chi \mathbf{E}$).
In **anisotropic materials** (like quartz or calcite crystals), the atoms are arranged differently in different directions. An electric field applied along the x-axis might induce a response (displacement of charges) along the x, y, and z axes due to the internal restoring forces not being symmetric.
**Tensor Relation:**
Thus, $\mathbf{P}$ is not necessarily parallel to $\mathbf{E}$. Each component of $\mathbf{P}$ depends on all components of $\mathbf{E}$:
$$ P_i = \epsilon_0 \sum_j \chi_{ij} E_j $$
Matrix form:
$$ \begin{pmatrix} P_x \\ P_y \\ P_z \end{pmatrix} = \epsilon_0 \begin{pmatrix} \chi_{xx} & \chi_{xy} & \chi_{xz} \\ \chi_{yx} & \chi_{yy} & \chi_{yz} \\ \chi_{zx} & \chi_{zy} & \chi_{zz} \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} E_x \\ E_y \\ E_z \end{pmatrix} $$
The susceptibility $\chi$ is a second-rank tensor (3x3 matrix) describing this directional dependence.
