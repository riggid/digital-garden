## 📝 Selected Previous Year Questions

### 1. Lasers and Optical Fibers
1. **Einstein's Coefficients**: Derive the relation between Einstein's coefficients of spontaneous emission ($A_{21}$) and stimulated emission ($B_{21}$).
2. **Laser Action**: Explain the specific conditions required for laser action. What is population inversion and why is a metastable state necessary?
3. **CO2 Laser**: Describe the construction and working of a CO2 laser with the help of a neat diagram. Discuss the role of Nitrogen and Helium in the process.
4. **Semiconductor Laser**: Distinguish between Homojunction and Heterojunction semiconductor lasers. Explain the working principle of a GaAs semiconductor laser.
5. **Optical Fibers**: Define Numerical Aperture (NA) and derive an expression for it. Discuss the different types of optical fibers (Step Index vs. Graded Index).

### 2. Holography and Dielectrics
1. **Holography Principle**: Explain the basic principle of Holography. Differentiate between Holography and Photography.
2. **Recording and Reconstruction**: With neat diagrams, explain the process of recording and reconstruction of a hologram.
3. **Dielectrics**: Define Dielectric Polarization. Explain the different types of polarization mechanisms (Electronic, Ionic, Orientational) with relevant formulae.
4. **Internal Field**: Derive an expression for the internal field in a solid or liquid dielectric (Lorentz Field).
5. **Clausius-Mossotti Relation**: Deduce the Clausius-Mossotti equation relating macroscopic dielectric constant with microscopic polarizability.
