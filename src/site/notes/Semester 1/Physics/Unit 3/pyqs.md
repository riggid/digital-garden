## 📝 Selected Previous Year Questions

### Magnetic Materials & Superconductivity
1. **Magnetic Monopoles**: The divergence of the magnetic field is zero ($\nabla \cdot B = 0$). Explain the physical significance of this statement regarding the existence of magnetic monopoles.
2. **Superconductivity**: Distinguish between Type I and Type II superconductors with relevant examples.
3. **Meissner Effect**: Define the Meissner effect and explain why superconductors are considered perfect diamagnets.

### Electrical Properties & Hall Effect
1. **Classical Free Electron Theory (CFET)**: Discuss the assumptions of the Classical Free Electron Theory. What were its successes and major failures?
2. **Fermi Energy**: Define Fermi Energy. Sketch and explain the Fermi-Dirac distribution function at $T=0K$ and $T>0K$.
3. **Hall Effect**: What is the Hall Effect? Derive an expression for the Hall Coefficient ($R_H$) and Hall Voltage ($V_H$). Mention its applications.
4. **Density of States**: Derive an expression for the Density of States $g(E)$ for a free electron gas in 3 dimensions.
