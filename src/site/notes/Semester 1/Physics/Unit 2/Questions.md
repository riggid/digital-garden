## Potential Step & Barrier Tunneling
***

### 1. Define reflection coefficient (R) and transmission coefficient (T) w.r.t step potential.

#### Answer
Classically, R is the ratio of reflected intensity to incident intensity, and T is the ratio of transmitted intensity to incident intensity. Quantum mechanically, intensity corresponds to probability density flux.
$$R = \frac{|\text{Reflected Flux}|}{|\text{Incident Flux}|}$$
$$T = \frac{|\text{Transmitted Flux}|}{|\text{Incident Flux}|}$$
In both cases, probability (or flux) is conserved, so $R + T = 1$.

---
### 2. Particle ($m, E$) moves towards potential step $V_0$. If $E>V_0$, obtain the expression for R using continuity conditions.

#### Answer
The wave functions are $\psi_1 = A e^{ik_1 x} + B e^{-ik_1 x}$ (Region 1) and $\psi_2 = D e^{ik_2 x}$ (Region 2).
Continuity at $x=0$:
1. $\psi_1(0) = \psi_2(0) \implies A+B=D$
2. $\psi_1'(0) = \psi_2'(0) \implies ik_1(A-B) = ik_2 D \implies k_1(A-B) = k_2 D$

Substitute D from (1) into (2): $k_1(A-B) = k_2(A+B)$.
$k_1 A - k_1 B = k_2 A + k_2 B$
$A(k_1 - k_2) = B(k_1 + k_2)$
$\frac{B}{A} = \frac{k_1 - k_2}{k_1 + k_2}$

Reflection Coefficient $R = \frac{|B|^2}{|A|^2} = \left|\frac{k_1 - k_2}{k_1 + k_2}\right|^2 = \left(\frac{k_1 - k_2}{k_1 + k_2}\right)^2$.

---
### 3. If $R = \frac{(k_1-k_2)^2}{(k_1+k_2)^2}$, and a 5 eV electron encounters a 2 eV step, find R.

#### Answer
$E=5$ eV, $V_0=2$ eV. $E > V_0$.
$k_1 \propto \sqrt{E}$
$k_2 \propto \sqrt{E-V_0}$
$R = \left(\frac{k_1 - k_2}{k_1 + k_2}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{E} - \sqrt{E-V_0}}{\sqrt{E} + \sqrt{E-V_0}}\right)^2$
$R = \left(\frac{\sqrt{5} - \sqrt{5-2}}{\sqrt{5} + \sqrt{5-2}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{5} - \sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{5} + \sqrt{3}}\right)^2$
$R = \left(\frac{2.236 - 1.732}{2.236 + 1.732}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{0.504}{3.968}\right)^2 \approx (0.127)^2 \approx 0.016$
The probability of reflection is about 1.6%.

---
### 4. Explain penetration depth.

#### Answer
Penetration depth ($\Delta x$) is the characteristic distance a particle's wave function penetrates into a classically forbidden region (where $E < V_0$). In this region, the wave function decays exponentially ($\psi \propto e^{-\alpha x}$). The penetration depth is usually defined as the distance over which the wave function's amplitude drops to $1/e$ (about 37%) of its value at the boundary.
$$\Delta x = \frac{1}{\alpha} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2m(V_0-E)}}$$
It signifies that there's a non-zero probability of finding the particle within this depth inside the barrier, even though it's classically forbidden.

---
### 5. What is quantum mechanical tunneling? Explain significance.

#### Answer
Quantum tunneling is the phenomenon where a quantum particle can pass through a potential energy barrier even if its total energy ($E$) is less than the barrier height ($V_0$). Classically, the particle would be reflected. Quantum mechanically, the wave function decays exponentially inside the barrier but remains non-zero, allowing a finite probability for the particle to appear on the other side.
**Significance:** Tunneling explains phenomena impossible in classical physics, such as:
* **Alpha decay:** Alpha particles escaping the nucleus.
* **Nuclear fusion:** Protons overcoming Coulomb repulsion in stars.
* **Technology:** Operation of Scanning Tunneling Microscopes (STM), Tunnel Diodes, and contributions to chemical reactions.

---
### 6. Interpret the wave function nature in the three regions of barrier potential ($E < V_0$).

#### Answer
* **Region I (Before Barrier, $x<0, V=0$):** $\psi_1(x) = A e^{ik_1 x} + B e^{-ik_1 x}$. This represents a superposition of an incident wave ($A e^{ik_1 x}$) moving towards the barrier and a reflected wave ($B e^{-ik_1 x}$) moving away. The wave function is **oscillatory**.
* **Region II (Inside Barrier, $0<x<L, V=V_0$):** $\psi_2(x) = F e^{-\alpha x} + G e^{\alpha x}$. This is a combination of decaying ($e^{-\alpha x}$) and potentially growing ($e^{\alpha x}$) exponential functions (real exponentials, not oscillations). It describes the **evanescent wave** within the barrier.
* **Region III (After Barrier, $x>L, V=0$):** $\psi_3(x) = H e^{ik_1 x}$. This represents only a transmitted wave moving away from the barrier. The wave function is **oscillatory** again, with the same wavelength as the incident wave but a much smaller amplitude ($|H| < |A|$).

---
### 7. Proton and alpha particle (same E) approach a barrier $V_0 > E$. Same tunneling probability? Which is greater?

#### Answer
No, they do not have the same tunneling probability. The approximate transmission probability $T \propto e^{-2\alpha L}$, where $\alpha = \sqrt{2m(V_0-E)/\hbar^2}$.
Since $E$ and $V_0$ are the same, $\alpha \propto \sqrt{m}$.
An alpha particle is significantly heavier than a proton ($m_\alpha \approx 4 m_p$).
Therefore, $\alpha$ is larger for the alpha particle.
Since $\alpha$ appears in a negative exponent, a larger $\alpha$ leads to a smaller $T$.
The **proton** (lighter particle) has a **greater probability** of tunneling through the barrier.

---
### 8. Alpha particle $T = 2.54 \times 10^{-24}$. Velocity $v=1.7 \times 10^7$ m/s, nuclear radius $R=10^{-14}$ m. Calculate mean lifetime $\tau$.

#### Answer
Frequency of collisions with barrier $n = v / (2R) = (1.7 \times 10^7) / (2 \times 10^{-14}) = 8.5 \times 10^{20}$ s⁻¹.
Probability of escape per second $P = n \times T = (8.5 \times 10^{20}) \times (2.54 \times 10^{-24}) \approx 2.16 \times 10^{-3}$ s⁻¹.
Mean lifetime $\tau = 1 / P = 1 / (2.16 \times 10^{-3}) \approx 463$ s.
$463 \, s = 7 \times 60 + 43 \approx 7$ minutes $43$ seconds.

## Particle in a Box & Finite Well
---

### 9. Show energy $E_n$ is quantized for electron in 1D infinite well (length L). Is $E=0$ allowed? Why?

#### Answer
Inside the well ($0<x<L$, $V=0$), the SWE solution is $\psi(x) = A \sin(kx) + B \cos(kx)$ with $k=\sqrt{2mE/\hbar^2}$.
Boundary conditions $\psi(0)=0$ and $\psi(L)=0$ require $B=0$ and $kL=n\pi$ for $n=1, 2, 3, \dots$.
Substituting $k=n\pi/L$ into the expression for $k$ gives:
$\frac{n\pi}{L} = \sqrt{\frac{2mE_n}{\hbar^2}} \implies \frac{n^2\pi^2}{L^2} = \frac{2mE_n}{(h/2\pi)^2} = \frac{8m\pi^2 E_n}{h^2}$.
$$E_n = \frac{n^2 h^2}{8mL^2}$$
Since $n$ must be a positive integer ($n=1, 2, 3, \dots$), the energy $E_n$ can only take discrete, quantized values.
The state $n=0$ is not allowed because it leads to $k=0$ and $\psi(x)=A\sin(0)+B\cos(0)=B$. For $\psi(L)=0$, B must be 0, resulting in $\psi(x)=0$ everywhere. This means the particle is not in the well, violating the premise. Since $n \neq 0$, the minimum energy is $E_1 = h^2/(8mL^2)$, which is greater than zero. Therefore, the electron **cannot have zero energy**. This non-zero minimum energy is called the **zero-point energy**.

---
### 10. Elaborate on parity for Eigen functions. When is parity applicable?

#### Answer
**Parity** describes the symmetry of a wave function $\psi(x)$ under inversion of the coordinate ($x \to -x$).
* **Even Parity:** If $\psi(-x) = +\psi(x)$. The function is symmetric about the origin.
* **Odd Parity:** If $\psi(-x) = -\psi(x)$. The function is anti-symmetric about the origin.

Parity is a useful concept when the **potential energy $V(x)$ is symmetric**, i.e., $V(-x) = V(x)$. For symmetric potentials (like the infinite well centered at $x=0$ or the harmonic oscillator), the solutions (Eigen functions) of the SWE can always be chosen to have definite parity (either purely even or purely odd).
For the infinite potential well centered at $x=0$ (width $a$, from $-a/2$ to $+a/2$):
* $\psi_n(x) \propto \cos(n\pi x/a)$ for $n=1, 3, 5, \dots$ (Even parity)
* $\psi_n(x) \propto \sin(n\pi x/a)$ for $n=2, 4, 6, \dots$ (Odd parity)

---
### 11. Write wave functions for $n=1, 2, 3$ for particle in infinite square well (symmetric, width a).

#### Answer
For a symmetric well from $-a/2$ to $+a/2$:
* $n=1$ (odd n): $\psi_1(x) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{a}} \cos\left(\frac{\pi x}{a}\right)$ (Even parity)
* $n=2$ (even n): $\psi_2(x) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{a}} \sin\left(\frac{2\pi x}{a}\right)$ (Odd parity)
* $n=3$ (odd n): $\psi_3(x) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{a}} \cos\left(\frac{3\pi x}{a}\right)$ (Even parity)

---
### 12. Plot probability densities $|\psi_n(x)|^2$ for $n=1, 2, 3$ (first three states) for electron in infinite well (width L).

#### Answer
(Assuming well from $x=0$ to $x=L$, $\psi_n(x) = \sqrt{2/L}\sin(n\pi x/L)$).
Probability density $P_n(x) = |\psi_n(x)|^2 = \frac{2}{L} \sin^2(\frac{n\pi x}{L})$.

* **n=1 (Ground State):** $P_1(x) = \frac{2}{L} \sin^2(\frac{\pi x}{L})$. Single peak centered at $x=L/2$. Zeroes at $x=0, L$.
    
* **n=2 (First Excited State):** $P_2(x) = \frac{2}{L} \sin^2(\frac{2\pi x}{L})$. Two peaks centered at $x=L/4$ and $x=3L/4$. Zeroes at $x=0, L/2, L$.
    
* **n=3 (Second Excited State):** $P_3(x) = \frac{2}{L} \sin^2(\frac{3\pi x}{L})$. Three peaks centered at $x=L/6, L/2, 5L/6$. Zeroes at $x=0, L/3, 2L/3, L$.

### 13. Find least energy of electron in 1D infinite box (width 0.05 nm).

#### Answer
$E_n = \frac{n^2 h^2}{8mL^2}$. Least energy is $E_1$.
$L = 0.05 \times 10^{-9}$ m. $m = 9.11 \times 10^{-31}$ kg. $h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34}$ Js.
$E_1 = \frac{(1)^2 (6.626 \times 10^{-34})^2}{8 (9.11 \times 10^{-31}) (0.05 \times 10^{-9})^2}$
$E_1 \approx 2.41 \times 10^{-17}$ J.
$E_1 (eV) = (2.41 \times 10^{-17}) / (1.602 \times 10^{-19}) \approx 150.4$ eV.

---
### 14. What happens to wavefunction and energy levels if infinite well width doubles ($L \to 2L$)?

#### Answer
**Energy Levels:** $E_n = \frac{n^2 h^2}{8mL^2}$. If $L \to 2L$, the new energy $E_n' = \frac{n^2 h^2}{8m(2L)^2} = \frac{n^2 h^2}{8m(4L^2)} = \frac{1}{4} E_n$.
The energy levels become **one-quarter** of their original values and get **closer together**.

**Wave Functions:** $\psi_n(x) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{L}} \sin(\frac{n\pi x}{L})$. The new function $\psi_n'(x) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{2L}} \sin(\frac{n\pi x}{2L})$.
The amplitude $\sqrt{2/L}$ **decreases**, and the function becomes **spatially stretched** over the wider interval $0 < x < 2L$. The number of nodes ($n-1$) remains the same for a given $n$.

### 15. Electron in 3D cubic infinite well (L=1nm). Compute energy difference between ground and second excited state.

#### Answer
Energy $E_{n_x,n_y,n_z} = \frac{h^2}{8mL^2}(n_x^2+n_y^2+n_z^2) = E_0(n_x^2+n_y^2+n_z^2)$, where $E_0=\frac{h^2}{8mL^2}$.
Ground State: $(n_x,n_y,n_z)=(1,1,1)$. $E_{111} = E_0(1^2+1^2+1^2) = 3E_0$.
First Excited State: $(2,1,1)$ or $(1,2,1)$ or $(1,1,2)$. $E_{211} = E_0(2^2+1^2+1^2) = 6E_0$. (Triply degenerate).
Second Excited State: $(2,2,1)$ or $(2,1,2)$ or $(1,2,2)$. $E_{221} = E_0(2^2+2^2+1^2) = 9E_0$. (Triply degenerate).
Energy Difference $\Delta E = E_{2nd Ex} - E_{Ground} = 9E_0 - 3E_0 = 6E_0$.
$E_0 = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})^2}{8 (9.11 \times 10^{-31}) (1 \times 10^{-9})^2} \approx 6.02 \times 10^{-20}$ J.
$\Delta E = 6 \times E_0 = 6 \times (6.02 \times 10^{-20}) \approx 3.61 \times 10^{-19}$ J.
$\Delta E (eV) = (3.61 \times 10^{-19}) / (1.602 \times 10^{-19}) \approx 2.25$ eV.

### 16. Show $\psi_{1,2}(x,y)=\frac{2}{L} \sin(\pi x/L) \sin(2\pi y/L)$ satisfies time-independent SWE inside a 2D well (LxL).

#### Answer
The time-independent SWE in 2D for $V=0$ is:
$-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}(\frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial y^2}) = E \psi$.
Let $\psi = \psi_{1,2}(x,y) = C \sin(k_x x) \sin(k_y y)$ where $C=2/L$, $k_x = \pi/L$, $k_y = 2\pi/L$.
$\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x} = C k_x \cos(k_x x) \sin(k_y y)$
$\frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial x^2} = -C k_x^2 \sin(k_x x) \sin(k_y y) = -k_x^2 \psi$.
Similarly, $\frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial y^2} = -k_y^2 \psi$.
Substitute into SWE:
$-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}(-k_x^2 \psi - k_y^2 \psi) = E \psi$.
$-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}(-(k_x^2+k_y^2))\psi = E \psi$.
$\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}(k_x^2+k_y^2)\psi = E \psi$.
This holds true if the energy $E$ is equal to $E = \frac{\hbar^2}{2m}(k_x^2+k_y^2)$.
Substitute $k_x=\pi/L, k_y=2\pi/L$ and $\hbar = h/2\pi$:
$E = \frac{(h/2\pi)^2}{2m}((\pi/L)^2 + (2\pi/L)^2) = \frac{h^2}{8m\pi^2} \frac{\pi^2}{L^2}(1^2+2^2)$.
$E = \frac{h^2}{8mL^2}(1^2+2^2)$.
This is the correct energy eigenvalue $E_{1,2}$ for the state $(n_x=1, n_y=2)$. Since the function satisfies the SWE with the correct eigenvalue, it is a valid solution (eigenfunction).

---
### 17. Solve time independent SWE for particle in 2D rectangular well ($a \times b$, infinite walls). Find $E$ and $\psi$ for first two states.

#### Answer
SWE: $-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}(\frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial y^2}) = E \psi$ inside ($0<x<a, 0<y<b$).
Use separation of variables: $\psi(x,y) = X(x)Y(y)$.
$-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}(Y X'' + X Y'') = E XY$. Divide by $XY$:
$-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}(\frac{X''}{X} + \frac{Y''}{Y}) = E$.
$\frac{X''}{X} = -\frac{2m E_x}{\hbar^2}$ and $\frac{Y''}{Y} = -\frac{2m E_y}{\hbar^2}$, where $E=E_x+E_y$.
These are 1D particle-in-a-box equations.
Solutions:
$X(x) = \sqrt{2/a} \sin(n_x \pi x / a)$, $E_x = \frac{n_x^2 h^2}{8ma^2}$, $n_x=1, 2, ...$
$Y(y) = \sqrt{2/b} \sin(n_y \pi y / b)$, $E_y = \frac{n_y^2 h^2}{8mb^2}$, $n_y=1, 2, ...$
Total Energy Eigenvalue: $E_{n_x,n_y} = \frac{h^2}{8m}(\frac{n_x^2}{a^2} + \frac{n_y^2}{b^2})$.
Eigenfunction: $\psi_{n_x,n_y}(x,y) = \sqrt{\frac{4}{ab}} \sin(\frac{n_x \pi x}{a}) \sin(\frac{n_y \pi y}{b})$.

First Two States (lowest energies):
1.  **Ground State:** $n_x=1, n_y=1$.
    $E_{1,1} = \frac{h^2}{8m}(\frac{1}{a^2} + \frac{1}{b^2})$.
    $\psi_{1,1}(x,y) = \sqrt{\frac{4}{ab}} \sin(\frac{\pi x}{a}) \sin(\frac{\pi y}{b})$.
2.  **First Excited State:** Depends on relative sizes of $a$ and $b$.
    * If $a > b$, then $1/a^2 < 1/b^2$. The next lowest energy is likely from increasing $n_x$ to 2: $(n_x=2, n_y=1)$.
      $E_{2,1} = \frac{h^2}{8m}(\frac{4}{a^2} + \frac{1}{b^2})$.
      $\psi_{2,1}(x,y) = \sqrt{\frac{4}{ab}} \sin(\frac{2\pi x}{a}) \sin(\frac{\pi y}{b})$.
    * If $b > a$, then $1/b^2 < 1/a^2$. The next lowest energy is likely from increasing $n_y$ to 2: $(n_x=1, n_y=2)$.
      $E_{1,2} = \frac{h^2}{8m}(\frac{1}{a^2} + \frac{4}{b^2})$.
      $\psi_{1,2}(x,y) = \sqrt{\frac{4}{ab}} \sin(\frac{\pi x}{a}) \sin(\frac{2\pi y}{b})$.
    * If $a=b$ (square well), then $E_{2,1}=E_{1,2}$ and the first excited state is doubly degenerate.

### 18. List first six possible distinct energy eigen states (energies and degeneracy) of 3D infinite well (cube, side L).

#### Answer
Energy $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = E_0 (n_x^2+n_y^2+n_z^2)$, where $E_0 = \frac{h^2}{8mL^2}$.

1.  $(1,1,1)$: $E=E_0(1+1+1) = 3E_0$. Degeneracy = 1.
2.  $(2,1,1), (1,2,1), (1,1,2)$: $E=E_0(4+1+1) = 6E_0$. Degeneracy = 3.
3.  $(2,2,1), (2,1,2), (1,2,2)$: $E=E_0(4+4+1) = 9E_0$. Degeneracy = 3.
4.  $(3,1,1), (1,3,1), (1,1,3)$: $E=E_0(9+1+1) = 11E_0$. Degeneracy = 3.
5.  $(2,2,2)$: $E=E_0(4+4+4) = 12E_0$. Degeneracy = 1.
6.  $(3,2,1)$ & permutations: $(3,2,1), (3,1,2), (2,3,1), (1,3,2), (2,1,3), (1,2,3)$. $E=E_0(9+4+1) = 14E_0$. Degeneracy = 6.

First six distinct energy *levels* are $3E_0, 6E_0, 9E_0, 11E_0, 12E_0, 14E_0$.

## Finite Well
---

### 19. How do Eigen energy levels of finite well compare with infinite well (same width)?

#### Answer
The allowed energy levels $E_n$ for a finite potential well are **lower** than the corresponding energy levels for an infinite potential well of the same width $L$. This is because the wave function penetrates into the walls of the finite well, effectively increasing the region over which the particle is spread (making the 'effective width' $> L$). According to the particle-in-a-box energy formula $E_n \propto 1/L^2$, a larger effective width leads to lower energy levels.

---
### 20. Outline mathematical process for finding Eigen values/functions for finite well.

#### Answer
1.  **Define Regions:** Set up the potential $V(x)=0$ inside ($-L/2 < x < L/2$) and $V(x)=V_0$ outside ($|x|>L/2$). Consider $E<V_0$.
2.  **Write SWE for each region:** Inside, it's oscillatory ($\psi''+k^2\psi=0$). Outside, it's exponential decay ($\psi''-\alpha^2\psi=0$).
3.  **Write General Solutions:** Inside: $\psi_{in} = A\sin(kx)+B\cos(kx)$. Outside: $\psi_{out, L} = C e^{\alpha x}$ ($x<-L/2$), $\psi_{out, R} = D e^{-\alpha x}$ ($x>L/2$).
4.  **Apply Boundary Conditions:** Require $\psi$ and $\psi'$ to be continuous at $x = \pm L/2$. This yields four equations relating A, B, C, D.
5.  **Simplify & Solve:** Solutions separate into even (cosine-like inside) and odd (sine-like inside) parity states. Applying boundary conditions leads to two **transcendental equations**:
    * Even states: $\alpha = k \tan(kL/2)$
    * Odd states: $\alpha = -k \cot(kL/2)$
    where $k=\sqrt{2mE/\hbar^2}$ and $\alpha=\sqrt{2m(V_0-E)/\hbar^2}$.
6.  **Find Eigenvalues (Energies):** Solve these transcendental equations graphically or numerically for the allowed discrete values of energy $E$. The number of solutions (bound states) is finite.
7.  **Find Eigenfunctions:** Substitute each allowed energy $E_n$ back into the boundary condition equations to find the relationships between A, B, C, D (up to an overall normalization constant) for each state $\psi_n$. Normalize the resulting $\psi_n$.

## Harmonic Oscillator
---

### 21. Give physical examples of quantum linear harmonic oscillator.

#### Answer
* **Vibrations of Diatomic Molecules:** The bond between two atoms acts like a spring, and their vibration about the equilibrium bond length can be approximated as a harmonic oscillator (especially for small displacements). This is fundamental to understanding infrared spectroscopy.
* **Vibrations of Atoms in a Crystal Lattice:** Atoms in a solid are held in place by interatomic forces. Their oscillations about their equilibrium lattice positions can be modeled as coupled harmonic oscillators. Quantized lattice vibrations are called **phonons**.
* **Quantum Fields:** In quantum field theory, fundamental fields can be described as collections of harmonic oscillators.

---
### 22. Write a note on Hermite polynomials.

#### Answer
**Hermite polynomials**, $H_n(\xi)$, are a set of orthogonal polynomials that arise as solutions to Hermite's differential equation, $y'' - 2\xi y' + 2ny = 0$. They are particularly important as they form part of the wave functions for the quantum harmonic oscillator.
* **Definition:** Can be defined by the Rodrigues formula: $H_n(\xi) = (-1)^n e^{\xi^2} \frac{d^n}{d\xi^n} (e^{-\xi^2})$.
* **First Few Polynomials:**
    * $H_0(\xi) = 1$
    * $H_1(\xi) = 2\xi$
    * $H_2(\xi) = 4\xi^2 - 2$
    * $H_3(\xi) = 8\xi^3 - 12\xi$
* **Recursion Relation:** $H_{n+1}(\xi) = 2\xi H_n(\xi) - 2n H_{n-1}(\xi)$.
* **Parity:** $H_n(\xi)$ has the same parity as $n$. $H_n(-\xi) = (-1)^n H_n(\xi)$. (Even for even n, odd for odd n).
* **Orthogonality:** They are orthogonal with respect to the weight function $e^{-\xi^2}$: $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-\xi^2} H_m(\xi) H_n(\xi) d\xi = \sqrt{\pi} 2^n n! \delta_{mn}$.

### 23. What is the physical significance of zero-point energy in QHO?

#### Answer
The **zero-point energy**, $E_0 = \frac{1}{2}\hbar\omega$, is the minimum possible energy a quantum harmonic oscillator can possess, even at absolute zero temperature. Its significance stems from the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle**: If the oscillator had zero energy, it would be perfectly stationary at its equilibrium position ($x=0, p=0$), implying exact knowledge of both position and momentum, which violates $\Delta x \Delta p \ge \hbar/2$. The zero-point energy represents the residual kinetic and potential energy associated with the unavoidable quantum fluctuations (minimum motion) required by the uncertainty principle. It means quantum systems are never truly "at rest".

---
### 24. Compare classical and quantum harmonic oscillator (2 differences).

#### Answer
1.  **Energy Quantization:**
    * **Classical:** Energy can take any continuous non-negative value ($E \ge 0$).
    * **Quantum:** Energy is quantized and can only take discrete values $E_n = (n+1/2)\hbar\omega$ for $n=0, 1, 2, \dots$.
2.  **Zero-Point Energy & Ground State:**
    * **Classical:** Minimum energy is zero (particle at rest at the equilibrium position).
    * **Quantum:** Minimum energy is the non-zero zero-point energy $E_0 = \frac{1}{2}\hbar\omega$. The oscillator is never completely at rest.
3.  **Probability Distribution & Tunneling:**
    * **Classical:** Particle oscillates between turning points ($\pm x_{max}$ where $E=V(x)$), spending most time near the turning points where speed is lowest. Probability is zero beyond turning points.
    * **Quantum:** Probability density $|\psi_n(x)|^2$ has peaks and nodes. For the ground state ($n=0$), probability is highest at the center ($x=0$). For higher states, it approaches the classical distribution. There is a non-zero probability of finding the particle *beyond* the classical turning points (tunneling into the forbidden region).

### 25. Write mathematical expressions for Eigen functions for first four quantum states (n=0,1,2,3) of QHO.

#### Answer
The general form is $\psi_n(x) = N_n H_n(\gamma x) e^{-\frac{1}{2}(\gamma x)^2}$ with $\gamma = \sqrt{m\omega/\hbar}$. Let $\xi = \gamma x$.
Normalization constants $N_n = (\frac{\gamma}{\sqrt{\pi} 2^n n!})^{1/2}$.
Hermite Polynomials $H_0=1, H_1=2\xi, H_2=4\xi^2-2, H_3=8\xi^3-12\xi$.

* **n=0:** $N_0 = (\frac{\gamma}{\sqrt{\pi}})^{1/2}$. $H_0=1$.
    $\psi_0(x) = (\frac{\gamma}{\sqrt{\pi}})^{1/2} e^{-\xi^2/2} = (\frac{m\omega}{\pi\hbar})^{1/4} e^{-\frac{m\omega}{2\hbar}x^2}$.
* **n=1:** $N_1 = (\frac{\gamma}{2\sqrt{\pi}})^{1/2}$. $H_1=2\xi$.
    $\psi_1(x) = (\frac{\gamma}{2\sqrt{\pi}})^{1/2} (2\gamma x) e^{-(\gamma x)^2/2}$.
* **n=2:** $N_2 = (\frac{\gamma}{8\sqrt{\pi}})^{1/2}$. $H_2=4\xi^2-2$.
    $\psi_2(x) = (\frac{\gamma}{8\sqrt{\pi}})^{1/2} (4(\gamma x)^2-2) e^{-(\gamma x)^2/2}$.
* **n=3:** $N_3 = (\frac{\gamma}{48\sqrt{\pi}})^{1/2}$. $H_3=8\xi^3-12\xi$.
    $\psi_3(x) = (\frac{\gamma}{48\sqrt{\pi}})^{1/2} (8(\gamma x)^3-12(\gamma x)) e^{-(\gamma x)^2/2}$.

### 26. How does energy level spacing in anharmonic oscillator differ from harmonic?

#### Answer
In a **harmonic oscillator**, the energy levels $E_n = (n+1/2)\hbar\omega$ are **equally spaced**, with the separation between adjacent levels being constant: $\Delta E = E_{n+1} - E_n = \hbar\omega$.
In an **anharmonic oscillator**, due to higher-order terms in the potential energy, the energy levels are **not equally spaced**. Typically, the spacing between adjacent levels **decreases** as the quantum number $n$ increases. That is, $E_{n+1}-E_n < E_n-E_{n-1}$ for higher $n$.

## Hydrogen Atom

### 27. Why don't electrons in H atom spiral into nucleus (Quantum explanation)?

#### Answer
Quantum mechanics explains this through quantized energy levels and the uncertainty principle.
1.  **Quantized Energy Levels:** The electron can only exist in specific, discrete energy states ($E_n = -13.6/n^2$ eV). It cannot continuously lose energy by radiating, as classical electrodynamics predicts. It can only drop to a lower state by emitting a photon of specific energy.
2.  **Stable Ground State:** The lowest allowed energy level ($n=1$, $E_1 = -13.6$ eV) is stable. There are no lower energy states for the electron to fall into.
3.  **Uncertainty Principle:** If the electron were to collapse into the nucleus (position precisely known), its momentum would become highly uncertain (large). This high kinetic energy would prevent it from staying confined within the nucleus. The zero-point energy concept, derived from the uncertainty principle, dictates a minimum energy and spatial distribution even in the ground state.

### 28. What does a hydrogen atom orbital represent?

#### Answer
A hydrogen atom **orbital** ($\psi_{n,l,m_l}$) is a **mathematical wave function** that is a solution to the Schrödinger equation for the electron in the atom. It describes the quantum state of the electron, characterized by the quantum numbers $n, l, m_l$.
Physically, the square of the orbital's magnitude, $|\psi_{n,l,m_l}(r,\theta,\phi)|^2$, represents the **probability density** of finding the electron at a particular point $(r,\theta,\phi)$ in space around the nucleus. It does *not* represent a fixed path or orbit like in the Bohr model, but rather a region of space where the electron is likely to be found (often visualized as an "electron cloud"). The shape, size, and orientation of this probability distribution are determined by the quantum numbers $l$ and $m_l$.

### 29. Discuss necessity for spherical polar coordinates to solve SWE for H atom.

#### Answer
The potential energy of the electron in a hydrogen atom is due to the Coulomb attraction to the nucleus: $V(r) = -e^2/(4\pi\epsilon_0 r)$. This potential depends only on the distance $r$ from the nucleus, meaning it has **spherical symmetry**.
The Schrödinger equation involves the Laplacian operator ($\nabla^2$). While the SWE can be written in Cartesian coordinates $(x,y,z)$, solving it becomes extremely difficult because the potential $V = -e^2/(4\pi\epsilon_0 \sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2})$ does not separate easily in this system.
Using **spherical polar coordinates $(r, \theta, \phi)$** is necessary because:
1.  **Symmetry Matching:** The coordinate system matches the symmetry of the potential ($V$ depends only on $r$).
2.  **Separation of Variables:** The Laplacian operator has a convenient form in spherical coordinates that allows the SWE to be separated into three independent ordinary differential equations: one for the radial part $R(r)$, one for the polar part $\Theta(\theta)$, and one for the azimuthal part $\Phi(\phi)$.
Solving these simpler, separated equations is feasible and naturally leads to the three quantum numbers ($n, l, m_l$) that characterize the electron's state.

## Fermi-Dirac Statistics & Density of States
---

### 30. Explain Fermi factor and its temperature dependence.

#### Answer
The **Fermi factor** $f(E)$ (or Fermi-Dirac distribution function) gives the probability that a quantum state with energy $E$ is occupied by an identical fermion (like an electron) in a system at thermal equilibrium at absolute temperature $T$. It is given by:
$$f(E) = \frac{1}{e^{(E-E_f)/(k_B T)} + 1}$$
where $E_f$ is the Fermi energy and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.

**Temperature Dependence:**
* **At T=0 K:** The function is a sharp step function. $f(E)=1$ for all states with energy $E < E_f$ (fully occupied). $f(E)=0$ for all states with energy $E > E_f$ (completely empty).
* **At T > 0 K:** Thermal energy allows some fermions to be excited to states above $E_f$. The step function becomes smeared out around $E_f$.
    * For $E = E_f$, the exponent is zero, $e^0=1$, so $f(E_f) = 1/(1+1) = 1/2$. The Fermi energy is the level with exactly 50% probability of occupation.
    * For $E < E_f$, $f(E)$ is slightly less than 1.
    * For $E > E_f$, $f(E)$ is slightly greater than 0.
    * The transition from $f(E) \approx 1$ to $f(E) \approx 0$ occurs over an energy range of a few $k_B T$ centered around $E_f$. As temperature increases, this transition region becomes wider.

### 31. Show P(occupancy at $E_f - \Delta E$) = P(non-occupancy at $E_f + \Delta E$).

#### Answer
Probability of occupancy at $E_1 = E_f - \Delta E$:
$f(E_1) = \frac{1}{e^{(E_1-E_f)/(k_B T)} + 1} = \frac{1}{e^{-\Delta E / (k_B T)} + 1}$.

Probability of non-occupancy at $E_2 = E_f + \Delta E$:
$P(\text{non-occ}) = 1 - f(E_2) = 1 - \frac{1}{e^{(E_2-E_f)/(k_B T)} + 1} = 1 - \frac{1}{e^{\Delta E / (k_B T)} + 1}$.
$P(\text{non-occ}) = \frac{(e^{\Delta E / (k_B T)} + 1) - 1}{e^{\Delta E / (k_B T)} + 1} = \frac{e^{\Delta E / (k_B T)}}{e^{\Delta E / (k_B T)} + 1}$.
Divide numerator and denominator by $e^{\Delta E / (k_B T)}$:
$P(\text{non-occ}) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-\Delta E / (k_B T)}}$.
This is the same expression as $f(E_1)$. Therefore, $f(E_f - \Delta E) = 1 - f(E_f + \Delta E)$.

### 32. Find T at which occupancy probability is i) 0.01 ii) 0.05 for state 0.3 eV above Fermi level.

#### Answer
We have $E - E_f = 0.3$ eV. $f(E) = \frac{1}{e^{(E-E_f)/(k_B T)} + 1}$.
Let $\Delta E = 0.3$ eV. $f(E) = \frac{1}{e^{\Delta E / (k_B T)} + 1}$.
We need to solve for T.
$e^{\Delta E / (k_B T)} + 1 = \frac{1}{f(E)}$.
$e^{\Delta E / (k_B T)} = \frac{1}{f(E)} - 1 = \frac{1 - f(E)}{f(E)}$.
$\frac{\Delta E}{k_B T} = \ln\left(\frac{1 - f(E)}{f(E)}\right)$.
$T = \frac{\Delta E}{k_B \ln\left(\frac{1 - f(E)}{f(E)}\right)}$.
Use $k_B = 8.617 \times 10^{-5}$ eV/K.

i) $f(E) = 0.01$:
   $\ln\left(\frac{1 - 0.01}{0.01}\right) = \ln(0.99 / 0.01) = \ln(99) \approx 4.60$.
   $T = \frac{0.3}{(8.617 \times 10^{-5})(4.60)} \approx \frac{0.3}{3.96 \times 10^{-4}} \approx 758$ K.

ii) $f(E) = 0.05$:
   $\ln\left(\frac{1 - 0.05}{0.05}\right) = \ln(0.95 / 0.05) = \ln(19) \approx 2.94$.
   $T = \frac{0.3}{(8.617 \times 10^{-5})(2.94)} \approx \frac{0.3}{2.53 \times 10^{-4}} \approx 1186$ K.

### 33. Arrive at expression for density of states (2D quantum structures).

#### Answer
For a 2D infinite square well of side L, energy is $E = \frac{h^2}{8mL^2}(n_x^2+n_y^2)$.
Consider "n-space" with axes $n_x, n_y$. Each state $(n_x, n_y)$ occupies unit area. States are in the first quadrant ($n_x>0, n_y>0$).
The number of states N(E) with energy less than E corresponds to the number of points within a quarter circle of radius $R = \sqrt{n_x^2+n_y^2} = \sqrt{8mL^2 E / h^2}$.
Area of quarter circle = $\frac{1}{4} \pi R^2$.
Number of states $N(R) \approx \frac{1}{4} \pi R^2$. (Approximation for large R).
$N(E) = \frac{\pi}{4} (\frac{8mL^2 E}{h^2}) = \frac{2\pi m L^2 E}{h^2}$.
Density of states per unit energy $dN/dE = \frac{2\pi m L^2}{h^2}$.
Density of states per unit energy per unit area ($g_{2D}(E)$): $A=L^2$.
$g_{2D}(E) = \frac{1}{A} \frac{dN}{dE} = \frac{1}{L^2} \frac{2\pi m L^2}{h^2} = \frac{2\pi m}{h^2}$.
Including spin degeneracy (multiply by 2):
$g_{2D}(E) = \frac{4\pi m}{h^2}$.
**Result:** The density of states in 2D is constant, independent of energy.
