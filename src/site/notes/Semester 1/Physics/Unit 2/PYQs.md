## 📝 Selected Previous Year Questions

### Problems & Conceptual Questions
1. **Compton Effect**: Write an expression for the Compton shift. Estimate the wavelength of incident light if the scattered light is detected at 0.15 nm at an angle of $135^\circ$.
2. **Quantum Mechanics Concepts**: Explain the following fundamental concepts:
   - **Normalization** of a wave function.
   - **Probability Density** ($\Psi^*\Psi$).
   - **Expectation Value** of an observable.

### Long Answer Questions
1. **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle**: State Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. Using this principle, show that an electron cannot exist inside the nucleus.
2. **Particle in a Box**: Set up the Schrödinger wave equation for a particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Solve it to derive the expressions for energy eigenvalues and eigenfunctions.
3. **Phase and Group Velocity**: Define Phase Velocity and Group Velocity. Derive the relation between them for a non-relativistic free particle.
4. **Physical Significance**: Discuss the physical significance of the wave function $\Psi$ and its interpretation.
