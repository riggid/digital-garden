## Lagrange's Linear Equations

### Question 1
The linear first-order PDE of the form $P(x,y,z)p + Q(x,y,z)q = R(x,y,z)$ is called the Lagrange's equation in independent variables x and y.
*   A) True
*   B) False

<details>
<summary><strong>Check Answer</strong></summary>

> **Correct Answer: A) True**
</details>

### Question 2
Consider the auxiliary equation $\frac{dx}{x} = \frac{dy}{y} = \frac{dz}{z}$. Which of the following is the general solution?
*   A) $\phi(x/y, y/z) = 0$
*   B) $\phi(x/y, z/x) = 0$
*   C) $\phi(y/z, z/x) = 0$
*   D) All the above

<details>
<summary><strong>Check Answer</strong></summary>

> **Correct Answer: D) All the above**
> 
> *From $\frac{dx}{x} = \frac{dy}{y} = \frac{dz}{z}$, we get $\ln x = \ln y + c_1$ and $\ln y = \ln z + c_2$, giving ratios x/y, y/z, z/x as constants.*
