## Chain Rule & Total Derivatives

### Question 1
The base radius r of a right circular cone is increasing at the rate of 1.5 mm/s while the perpendicular height h is decreasing at 6.0 mm/s. The rate at which the volume V is changing when r=12 mm and h=24 mm is
*   A) 3
*   B) 6
*   C) 0
*   D) 4

<details>
<summary><strong>Check Answer</strong></summary>

> **Correct Answer: C) 0**
> 
> $V = \frac{1}{3}\pi r^2 h$
> 
> $\frac{dV}{dt} = \frac{1}{3}\pi(2rh\frac{dr}{dt} + r^2\frac{dh}{dt})$
> 
> $= \frac{\pi}{3}(2(12)(24)(1.5) + (144)(-6))$
> 
> $= \frac{\pi}{3}(864 - 864) = 0$

## Homogeneous Functions & Euler's Theorem

### Question 1
In Euler's theorem for a homogeneous function u, the constant n indicates
*   A) the order of u
*   B) the degree of u

*   A) True
*   B) False

<details>
<summary><strong>Check Answer</strong></summary>

> **Correct Answer: A) True**
> 
> *Lagrange multipliers find critical points but don't directly classify them as max/min/saddle.*
</details>

### Question 3
