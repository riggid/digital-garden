      • Divisible by 5 -print BUZZ
      • Divisible by both 3 and 5 -FIZZBUZZ

       n = int(input("Enter the number:"))
       if n%3==0 and n%5==0:
           print("FIZZBUZZ")
       elif n%3==0:
           print("FIZZ")
       elif n%5==0:
           print("BUZZ")
       else:
           print("Number neither divible by 3 or 5")
2. Write a python program that takes the name and age of the user as input and
   displays a message whether the user is eligible to apply for a driving license or not.
   (the eligible age is 18 years).




3. Write a python program to check if the year entered by the user is a leap year or
   not.
   Note: Conditions for a Leap Year Here are the two conditions that any year must satisfy
   to be called a leap year
   1. The year must be perfectly divisible by 400.
   2. The number must be divisible by 4 but not by 100.




4. Write a python program using control structures to print the following pattern:
5. What is the difference between implicit type conversion and explicit type
   conversion?
   Python internally changes the data type of some operands so that all operands have same
   data type. This type of conversion is automatic, that is it is called implicit type
   conversion.
   Eg: If we have 10.5/3, then by default python will promote the denominator 3 from
   integer type to 3.0 which is of float type, this is implicit type conversion.

   An explicit type conversion is user-defined conversion that forces an expression to be of
   specific type.. This explicit type conversion is also known as Type casting.
   Eg: if we have a=3 and b=5.0, then
    int(b)
   will cast the data-type of the expression as int.
   Similarly,
   d= float(a)
   will assign value 3.0 to d because float(a) cast the expression’s value to float type and
   then assigned it to d.

6. What is the output of following code?
   a = True
   b = False
   c = False

   if not a or b:
      print (1)
   elif not a or not b and c:
      print (2)
   elif not a or b or not b and a:
      print (3)
   else:
      print (4)

   Answer : 3

7. What is the output for following code?
   a = True
   b = False
   c = False

   if a or b and c:
      print ("HELLOWORLD")
   else:
      print ("helloworld")
   Answer: HELLOWORLD

8. What will be the output of following python code?
   for i in range(0,10,2):
           if(i % 5==0):
                   print(i)
   Answer: 0

9. How many ways are there in Python to represent an integer literal?
   Python allows three types of integer literals:

       a) Decimal (base 10) integer literals : An integer literal consisting of a sequence of
          digits is taken to be decimal integer literal unless it begins with 0 (digit zero). For
          instance, 1234, 41, +97, -17 are decimal integer literals.

       b) Octal (base 8) integer literals: A sequence of digits starting with 0o(digit zero
          followed by letter o) is taken to be an octal integer. For instance, decimal integer 8
          will be written as 0o10 as octal integer and decimal integer 12 will be written
          0o14 as octal integer.
       c) Hexadecimal (base 16) integer literals: A sequence of digits preceded by 0x or
          0X is taken to be an hexadecimal integer. For instance, decimal 12 will be written
          as 0XC as hexadecimal integer.

10. Which of the following identifier names are invalid and why?
      a) Serial_no. – dots not allowed
      b) 1st_room – must not begin with a digit
      c) Hundred$ - only special character allowed is underscore, $ not allowed
      d) Total marks- cannot contain space in between
      e) Total-marks – hyphen not allowed
      f) True- A keyword cannot be used as an identifier.

11. In how many different ways can you work in python?
    Python works in two modes:
        a) Interactive mode: In interactive mode, instructions are given in front of Python
           prompt (eg,, >>> ) in Python Shell. Python carries out the given instruction and
           shows the result there itself.

       b) Script/ Batch mode: Python instructions are stored in a file generally with .py
          extension and are executed together in one go as a unit. The saved instructions are
          known as Python script or Python program.

12. What are the advantages and limitations in python?
   Advantages of python:
           i.   It is a “Easy to use” programming language since it is both object oriented and
                procedural programming language, and ahigh level language.
          ii.   It is an “Expressive Language” since it has a simpler syntax and fewer lines of
                code.
         iii.   It is an interpreted language and hence easy to debug.
         iv.    Its Completeness- Since there are various modules in Python standard library for
                diverse functionality such as GUI Development, web-pages, emails, databases,
                network connections and many more.
           v.   It is a Cross-platform Language and can run equally well on variety of platforms-
                Windows, Linux/UNIX, Macintosh, Hence Python is a portable language
         vi.    It is a Free and open-source language as it is freely available along the source
                code.
         vii.   Variety of Usage/Applications-Some of the fields/applications of python
                programming is Scripting, Web Applications, Game Development, Database
                Applications GUI Programs, System Administrations.
 Disadvantages of Python:
           i.   Not the Fastest Language
          ii.   Less Libraries than C, Java, Perl
         iii.   Not strong on type-binding
         iv.    Not Easily Convertible
